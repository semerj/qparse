Buoyed by White House support and facing only tepid opposition from the nation's governors, Silicon Valley has state and local tax collectors on the defensive: Congress is on the verge of passing legislation that would effectively bar sales taxes on Internet transactions until 2004. "The outcome is not in doubt," said Rep. {{Christopher Cox}}, R- Calif., who is sponsoring the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the House. The bill responds to fears that a thicket of conflicting taxes will choke off the growth of Internet commerce, in particular inhibiting its use by small businesses that could not cope with the burden of the paperwork. But some analysts _ and many governors _ worry that a federal moratorium would set a precedent that would permanently deprive state and local governments of a huge potential revenue source. "If we don't tax Internet commerce now, it will never be taxed," said {{William Gale}}, {{William Gale}}. With a few exceptions, states have made little effort to tax Internet service providers like America Online. Retail sales through the Internet are, in theory, covered by "use" taxes that require consumers to pay taxes in their home states no matter where they buy. But under Supreme Court rulings, one state cannot compel a merchant in another to collect use taxes unless the merchant has a substantial business presence in the state where the buyer lives. That has not prevented businesses from imagining a day when states try to tax Internet use. In a survey of executives from large retailers and media corporations conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick in 1996, half said that tax ambiguities had already tempered plans for Internet commerce. And Sen. {{Ron Wyden}}, D- Ore., along with Cox, has been leading the charge for a legislative remedy. The Senate and House bills that have emerged from committee would bar taxes on monthly Internet access charges until January 2002. State and local governments would remain free to tax purchases made on the Internet, but the Cox-Wyden bill would bar attempts to go beyond the limits on out-of-state collection set by the Supreme Court. "The states would be no less able to collect sales taxes than they are today," {{Christopher Cox}} said. Many tax specialists sympathize with efforts to avoid discriminatory taxes on Internet service providers. "States are notorious for their inconsistencies, taxing services on a hit-or-miss basis," said {{Joel Slemrod}}, {{Joel Slemrod}}. By the same token, many sympathize with the problems that businesses _ particularly "mom and pop" stores expanding onto the Internet _ potentially face in selling to customers in thousands of different tax districts. But they are wary of precedents that effectively put Internet sales out of bounds to state and local tax collectors. "Internet commerce is small today," {{William Gale}} said, "but what happens to local tax bases when the Net becomes a major presence in retailing?" With flat-out opposition to the Internet legislation no longer a realistic option now that the president and the governors of New York, California and Virginia have taken a stance in favor of the Cox-Wyden bill, the National Governors' Association is pressing an alternative. Led by {{Michael Leavitt}} and Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the association is willing to accept a permanent prohibition on taxing access to the Internet. But in return, it wants Washington to give individual states a powerful incentive to create a single consolidated tax on out-of-state purchases, both electronic and mail order. The association's proposal would override the Supreme Court ruling by requiring large vendors to collect use taxes on behalf of states as long as the states conformed to a single tax structure. "Now is the time for a system that creates a level playing filed for all sellers," {{Michael Leavitt}} said. But the governors' approach faces strong opposition. Although their bill would meet the primary objective of Internet service providers, it would also open Internet commerce to taxation. "We see this as a new tax that would generate $16 billion in revenue by the year 2000," {{Ron Wyden}} said. Probably more important, it would tie Internet tax legislation to the fate of the states' attempts to force mail-order vendors to collect taxes from out-of-state customers. And because there is hardly a ground swell for such a move in Congress, there might be no legislation at all _ a result that would not unduly disturb most opponents of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The governors, it is generally conceded, are playing a weak political hand. House leaders are promising a floor vote on the Cox-Wyden bill this month. And last week, Senate Majority Leaser Trent Lott, R- Miss., predicted that the bill would come to a vote in the Senate by May. The real question, then, is whether the governors can salvage a compromise with the bill's congressional sponsors. "{{Michael Leavitt}}'m persuaded there is still a lot of common ground here," {{Michael Leavitt}} said.
