NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Thousands of laborers, students and opposition politicians on Saturday protested tax hikes imposed by their cash-strapped government, which they accused of failing to provide basic services. Beneath a scorching sun, they sang anti-government songs and chanted "{{Daniel arap Moi}} must go," showing their derision for {{Daniel arap Moi}}, {{Daniel arap Moi}}. By voice vote, the 5,000 protesters approved a resolution calling for the government to scrap new taxes, convene a convention to write a new Constitution, stop harassing students and street vendors, and halt ethnic violence. If the government doesn't respond to the demands, workers should go on strike April 3, said Kivutha Kibwana, of the National Convention Assembly, a group of opposition political, church and civic leaders who organized the rally. Although the crowd cheered its support, the assembly's calls for general strikes have failed in the past. Kenyans are most angered by tax increases announced earlier this month to plug a widening budget deficit. The price of gas and diesel went up, and tax deductions were revoked on gifts to charities and nonprofit organizations. Faced with a strike by bank workers, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae delayed plans to raise taxes on cut-rate loans provided by employers. Several politicians have charged that the high taxes Kenyans already pay go into the pockets of government officials or wasteful projects, and not into providing essential services and repairing crumbling infrastructure. "{{Kenneth Matiba}} would like {{Daniel arap Moi}} to explain and bring back the money {{Daniel arap Moi}} has stolen," said {{Kenneth Matiba}}. The International Monetary Fund has demanded spending cuts and tax hikes, warning that in the absence of corrective measures, Kenya's overall budget deficit for 1997 - 98 will reach 3.9 percent of the gross domestic product _ more than double the goal of 1.7 percent. The IMF last year withheld a dlrs 220 million loan from Kenya, citing official corruption and mismanagement. In contrast to other rallies which have drawn mostly male students, Saturday's rally also attracted laborers, businessmen and women. They demonstrated at the Kamukunji Grounds, a grassy field in Nairobi where Kenyans have often gathered to show their dissatisfaction with the government. "We, the people of Kenya, have met here several times. We have been beaten, we have shed blood, we have purchased the right to meet here today with our blood," said {{John Munuve}}, {{John Munuve}}. The protest was peaceful, and no police were deployed. In July, police killed more than a dozen demonstrators pressing for constitutional reforms before elections in December, in which {{Daniel arap Moi}} won a fifth, five-year term. (cm-kjd)
