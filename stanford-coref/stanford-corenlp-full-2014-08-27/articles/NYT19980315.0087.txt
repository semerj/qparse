NEW YORK _ Officials of the union representing Broadway's musicians are to meet with negotiators for producers and theater owners Tuesday to continue working out the final language of a tentative agreement on a new five-year contract. The agreement could be put to a vote of the members as early as next week, the officials said. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians called off a planned strike vote on Saturday when the tentative agreement was reached. The contract between the local and the League of American Producers and Theater Owners, which represents 36 of Broadway's 38 theaters, had expired on March 8, and last Tuesday the local's executive board had approved the strike vote. The tentative agreement calls for a wage increase of more than 21 percent over the life of the contract, said Judy West, a spokeswoman for the local, and Jed Bernstein, the league's executive director. The musicians are currently paid an average of $1,300 a week.
