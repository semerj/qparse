NEW YORK _ When the Metropolitan Opera first presented the {{Otto Schenk}} production of {{Wagner}} in 1993, {{Otto Schenk}} work, though conservative, was evocative and colorful, and {{James Levine}} conducting was spacious and nuanced. When the production was brought back two seasons ago, the production was even more humane, and {{James Levine}} conducting more luminous. "Die Meistersinger" returned on Monday night. The original reason for bringing it back was that {{James Morris}} was planning to sing {{Hans Sachs}} first {{Hans Sachs}}, one of opera's longest roles, {{Wagner}} wise shoemaker, a widower in medieval {{Nurnberg}} and the most beloved member of the town's guild of master singers. But {{James Morris}} withdrew last fall, and the Met had to come up fast with a replacement. In {{James Johnson}}, an American bass making {{James Johnson}} house debut, the company had {{Hans Sachs}}. Moreover, {{James Levine}} intricate and organic work seemed even deeper this time around. The orchestra playing on Monday positively glowed. Yet onstage there was a sense of a production thrown together and lacking inspiration, and the likely cause was the jokey and intrusively busy stage direction of {{David McClintock}}. "Die Meistersinger" is a comedy, but a tender, insightful and, at times, troubling comedy, not the antic fest it sometimes seemed here. Take, for example, the depiction of Beckmesser, the town clerk. Beckmesser may be laughable, but he must be endearingly laughable. His dream of marrying {{Eva Johansson}}, {{Eva Johansson}}, by winning the guild's annual song contest, and his scheming to outmaneuver {{Hans Sachs}} show {{Hans Sachs}} to be hapless, not nasty or stupid. {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}}, {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}}, sang the role splendidly but was not helped by the stage direction. When {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} nighttime serenade to {{Eva Johansson}} is mischievously interrupted by {{Hans Sachs}} cobbling, a pouting Beckmesser struts about the street in circles, {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} hands linked behind {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} back, a cartoonish and cliched idea. The aches and pains {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} suffers from the town brawl set off by {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} serenading were inanely overacted. Aside from the directorial slips, there were some vocal rewards, especially from the musicianly tenor Ben Heppner, who had a triumphant evening reprising the daunting role of the young knight Walther. His voice sounded rested, free and thrilling. {{James Johnson}} has a sturdy though not exceptional voice, and stamina. {{James Johnson}} could have projected more of {{Hans Sachs}} had {{Hans Sachs}} not been directed to act like a bully, shoving Beckmesser around at will, and flinging Eva at Walther (three times!), {{Hans Sachs}} the fatherly {{Hans Sachs}} would never do. {{Eva Johansson}}, {{Eva Johansson}}, made a lovely {{Eva Johansson}}, but the girlishness of {{Eva Johansson}} characterization was too aggressively projected, and at full volume her voice tended to turn harsh and wobbly. The Danish tenor Gert Henning-Jensen made his debut as {{Hans Sachs}} apprentice, {{David McClintock}}, and with his boyish looks and balletic agility he looked the part. But his voice was hard pressed in places. Wendy White was sympathetic as Magdalene, and {{Hans Sotin}} was {{Hans Sotin}}. The amassed sound of the Met chorus greeting Sachs in the final scene will not be easily forgotten. If only the antics of the stage direction could be cleaned up. It almost makes you long for Robert Wilson's glacial staging of "Lohengrin."
