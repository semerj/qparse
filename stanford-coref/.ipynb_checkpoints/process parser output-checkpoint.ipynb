        "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Thousands of laborers, students and opposition politicians on Saturday protested tax hikes imposed by their cash-strapped government, which they accused of failing to provide basic services. Beneath a scorching sun, they sang anti-government songs and chanted \"{{Daniel arap Moi}} must go,\" showing their derision for {{Daniel arap Moi}}, {{Daniel arap Moi}}. By voice vote, the 5,000 protesters approved a resolution calling for the government to scrap new taxes, convene a convention to write a new Constitution, stop harassing students and street vendors, and halt ethnic violence. If the government doesn't respond to the demands, workers should go on strike April 3, said Kivutha Kibwana, of the National Convention Assembly, a group of opposition political, church and civic leaders who organized the rally. Although the crowd cheered its support, the assembly's calls for general strikes have failed in the past. Kenyans are most angered by tax increases announced earlier this month to plug a widening budget deficit. The price of gas and diesel went up, and tax deductions were revoked on gifts to charities and nonprofit organizations. Faced with a strike by bank workers, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae delayed plans to raise taxes on cut-rate loans provided by employers. Several politicians have charged that the high taxes Kenyans already pay go into the pockets of government officials or wasteful projects, and not into providing essential services and repairing crumbling infrastructure. \"{{Kenneth Matiba}} would like {{Daniel arap Moi}} to explain and bring back the money {{Daniel arap Moi}} has stolen,\" said {{Kenneth Matiba}}. The International Monetary Fund has demanded spending cuts and tax hikes, warning that in the absence of corrective measures, Kenya's overall budget deficit for 1997 - 98 will reach 3.9 percent of the gross domestic product _ more than double the goal of 1.7 percent. The IMF last year withheld a dlrs 220 million loan from Kenya, citing official corruption and mismanagement. In contrast to other rallies which have drawn mostly male students, Saturday's rally also attracted laborers, businessmen and women. They demonstrated at the Kamukunji Grounds, a grassy field in Nairobi where Kenyans have often gathered to show their dissatisfaction with the government. \"We, the people of Kenya, have met here several times. We have been beaten, we have shed blood, we have purchased the right to meet here today with our blood,\" said {{John Munuve}}, {{John Munuve}}. The protest was peaceful, and no police were deployed. In July, police killed more than a dozen demonstrators pressing for constitutional reforms before elections in December, in which {{Daniel arap Moi}} won a fifth, five-year term. (cm-kjd)\n",

        "VATICAN CITY (AP) _ More than 10 years after it was promised in a meeting with Jewish leaders, a major Vatican document on the Holocaust is ready. The Vatican said Saturday the document would be made public on Monday. Jewish groups have been keenly awaiting the document to see if it will continue to heal Jewish-Catholic relations. The last Vatican document of landmark proportions on Jewish relations was a 1965 statement that came out of the Second Vatican Council under Paul VI. \"Nostra Aetate\" (In Our Times) condemned anti-Semitism and said the Jews cannot be collectively blamed for the crucifixion of Jesus. {{John Paul II}} has dedicated much of {{John Paul II}} nearly 20-year -old papacy to improving relations of the church with Jews, whom he refers to as \"older brothers,\" after centuries of animosity. Word of the latest document first came on Sept. 1, 1987, during a meeting between the pope and Jewish leaders in Castel Gandolfo, the pontiff's summer residence in the hills southeast of Rome. The unprecedented meeting was hurriedly called as anxiety built in the Vatican that Jews might boycott a ceremony during the then soon-approaching papal visit to the United States. Jews were angered by the pope's audience earlier that year with then Austrian President {{Kurt Waldheim}}, who was been accused of helping deport Jews to Nazi concentration camps, allegations {{Kurt Waldheim}} denied. The Castel Gandolfo meeting was the first time Jewish representatives had sat down for informal discussions with a pope. Representatives at the 1987 meeting said the Vatican planned to publish a major document dealing with anti-Semitism and the genocide of European Jews by the Nazis in World War II. Since that meeting, {{John Paul II}} has presided over several milestones that improved relations with Jews, including the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel in 1995. Another ground-breaking step was the pope's visit to Rome's main synagogue in 1986. Last fall, the pope told a Vatican seminar on anti-Jewish currents in Christian theology that centuries of anti-Jewish prejudice had figured in \"deadening\" Christian resistance toe the Nazi persecution of Jews. But, to the disappointment of some Jewish groups, the pope steered clear of blaming the church itself. (fd)"

        "PARIS (AP) - {{Christian Lacroix}}. It started out looking vaguely back to the 1940s with some \"Evita\" hairdos, short flared skirts, a few sharply-tailored shoulders in day wear. But then, there was not much day wear, and clothes soon went into Belle Epoque evenings, via a modern \"star trek\" of fabulous pearled fabrics. Minimalism, so fashionable on international runways these days, just does not grab {{Christian Lacroix}}. \"After ten years, we must find a balance between glamour and efficiency,\" said {{Jean-Jacques Picart}}, {{Jean-Jacques Picart}}, though the house is under the {{Louis Vuitton Moet Hennesy}} ({{Louis Vuitton Moet Hennesy}}) umbrella. The glamour will undoubtedly not die out. There were few clothes for day wear in this dressy collection that tended to the too-fussy, as {{Christian Lacroix}} often does. What to make of a trouser suit with its tweedy masculine trousers and ruffled lace-organza Victorian blouse? Or the very tight sequin-spattered knit dress with its faux mink appliques and high feathered hat? And with the spangled tights shown with all the short clothes, the show often teetered between the boulevard hooker territory and the disco. But there were many wonderful moments here, including an excellent short carmine moire silk coat tied at the waist over a sky-blue lace knit dress. Big fur collars and long tweed coats, the gold-black tiger-striped lame trapeze coat, some of the great frock coats, and a remarkable tie-dye effect silk in skirts and floppy 1930s pants, looked like winners. Sharply-fitted evening suits with pants had large, structured shoulders. {{Christian Lacroix}} has evolved quite far away from {{Christian Lacroix}} famous shawl and sloped shoulder looks of opening days over 10 years ago. The most modern-looking clothes were simply-cut soft gowns and trouser outfits in black, gray and white pearled and diamante fabrics with a milky way effect. And the party scene was complete in the Victorians or southern belle evening styles capped by a fabulous red velvet gown with crinolines and decollete a la Scarlet O'Hara, draped like curtains and topped by a little red topper riding hat. Earlier, {{Jean-Paul Gaultier}} went yet again to the Arctic Circle for inspiration - as {{Jean-Paul Gaultier}} did some years ago - but Friday night's offering was brilliant. The atmosphere was hot and smoky, a bar scene created in the Wagram dance hall, notorious for the \"Last Tango in Paris.\" But the models, including Naomi Campbell, were dressed up like Nanook of the North as they cavorted, smoked, drank champagne and kibitzed with the audience at the bar. There were many of those Siberian hats with flaps, fur, even sequins at the end, and the parkas were very good-looking, many quite tailored, in black and white. Some of the impressions were of hippies from outer space, but in spite of some crazy combinations like a layered look with long ethnic skirt, fringed tunic and striped blazer, there was much to admire. The folklore Nordic knits were handsome, in sweaters, or knee-length pants, and might have been topped by something like a super taffeta full coat. An excellent full gray knit sleeveless tunic with its straight white pants was another winner. A double-faced gray coat with its trouser suit was impeccable. For evening wear at the North Pole, girls could dress up in handsome Nordic sweaters and full iridescent taffeta skirts, or top one of the full striped skirts with a terrific short beige trench coat. \"I loved the show,\" said eminent English fashion historian Colin McDowell. \"It was indeed Nanook of the North - with a trace of existentialism.\" (sp-dgs)"

        "PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ He's a company director who wears the best suits, collects fine art and counts the influential among his friends. She's a worn-out refugee who sleeps under a borrowed blanket. Elsewhere, {{Milica Boskovic}}, chief executive of the Plastika factory, would have nothing in common with Ilinka Durbaba, stuck in a refugee camp for nearly three years. In Kosovo, they shoulder a common burden. They are Serbs in a part of Serbia controlled by a hostile Albanian majority that outnumbers them 9 to 1. And while the Albanians groan under repressive Serbian rule, the average Serb in Kosovo feels threatened by the specter of a secessionist war. The United States and other world powers consider the Kosovo Albanians victims, and back their struggle for autonomy, if not for independence. The Albanians lost the right to virtual self-rule in 1989. Most recently, Serb police killed at least 80 of them in a brutal two-week crackdown on militant separatists. As sympathy grows for the Albanians, hostility rises against Serbs, who often are equated with their repressive government. But in Kosovo, Serbs, too, are victims. Most work at low-paying government jobs or state companies that often cannot meet payroll. Albanians, victims of mass firings in the early 1990s, now dominate the private sector, their prosperity reflected in large houses and modern stores. Kosovo Serbs are a despised minority on home ground. But they cannot leave _ to keep them there, the government has forbidden property sales. {{Milica Boskovic}}, {{Milica Boskovic}}, flinches when an Albanian boy spits at {{Milica Boskovic}}. \"This isn't the worst of it,\" {{Milica Boskovic}} says. Other Serb parents nod. They walk their children to school, fearful of abuse from Albanian kids. The school is split by a wall _ one side for Serbs, the other for Albanians. \"Their kids swear at our kids,\" says {{Milica Boskovic}}, mother of 7 - and 8-year old boys. At the Plastika factory, {{Milica Boskovic}} says {{Milica Boskovic}} does what {{Milica Boskovic}} can for harmony _ half {{Milica Boskovic}} work force is ethnic Albanian. Loyalties were forged after the plant burned down in 1983, one of several fires thought set by Albanian separatists. {{Milica Boskovic}} called a workers' meeting ahead of rebuilding. \"I told them, 'Here, I am {{Tito}}, your {{Slobodan Milosevic}}, your Rugova,\"' said {{Milica Boskovic}}, referring respectively to the leader of the former communist Yugoslavia, who gave Kosovo automony; {{Tito}} successor who took it away, and the ethnic Albanian leader now seeking independence. \"You've all got mouths to feed, whether they are Serb or Albanian.\" Born and raised in Kosovo, {{Milica Boskovic}} is proud of {{Milica Boskovic}} roots in the province, the cradle of Serb culture and Orthodox religion. Pictures in {{Milica Boskovic}} lavish office show him with archbishops, Serb royalty _ and Zeljko Raznatovic, a.k.a Arkan, the Serb ultranationalist whose troops are accused of atrocities in Croatia, Bosnia, and, most recently, Kosovo. \"Where would I go?\" he replies, when asked if he is contemplating leaving. \"We must talk to them,\" {{Milica Boskovic}} says of the Albanians. \"We should have talked to them a long time ago.\" At the hairdresser's, Serb women discuss options. Stay or go? They reflect on their good times in the 1950s and 1960s, and what they view as {{Tito}} greatest mistake _ giving Kosovo autonomy in 1974. That, a high Albanian birthrate and an influx from neighboring Albania left the Serbs cornered by the 1980s. \"We had everything,\" says {{Zhivka Savic}}, 65. \"They had nothing.\" The reverse seems true now. The two-chair salon is squeezed among modern, well-equipped Albanian shops. \"Compare {{Zhivka Savic}} little house to a six-story Albanian one,\" Mrs. {{Zhivka Savic}} rails, ignoring warnings from other women to hush because of the thin wall and the Albanian shop next door. \"Sell to an Albanian? In a minute, if they let us.\" \"In my street,... Albanian kids have started chanting 'we are the terrorists.\" {{Milanka Milentijevic}} says 80 percent of {{Milanka Milentijevic}} customers were Albanians in the 1970s. \"Now, {{Milanka Milentijevic}} have one a month. Business is down 95 percent,\" {{Milanka Milentijevic}} says. \"Even the Serbs who could afford to come left a long time ago.\" About 200 of {{Milanka Milentijevic}} relatives have left the area, but {{Milanka Milentijevic}} wants to stay _ for now. {{Milanka Milentijevic}} describes Albanian acquaintances as \"friends in hiding.\" \"We talk about everything. Families, politics,\" says {{Milanka Milentijevic}}, 50. \"Sometimes we even joke about the situation.\" {{Ilinka Durbaba}}, the refugee, contemplates {{Ilinka Durbaba}} options. Sitting on a cot in a space blanketed off from the next family, she says she started running at 3, from the Germans during World War II. In 1995, she fled her town of Knin in Croatia, when Croats recaptured it from rebel Serbs, who had seized it in 1991. Is it time to run again? \"I have nowhere to go,\" she says, sobbing. She turns to a poster of {{Slobodan Milosevic}}, {{Slobodan Milosevic}}. He stoked the war that forced her to flee Knin and his decision to abolish Kosovo's autonomy radicalized the Albanians. \"{{Ilinka Durbaba}} love him,\" says {{Ilinka Durbaba}}. \"He's good for everybody who loves peace.\""

Now, in the height of the dry season, the forests are susceptible to fire and significant rainfall is unlikely before June. The lack of rainfall has already affected such varied industries as rice farming and gold mining. Some of the 35,000 residents of the bauxite mining town of Linden, 70 miles (113 kilometers) south of Georgetown, say the smoke is beginning to affect them.

        "VATICAN CITY (AP) _ More than 10 years after it was promised in a meeting with Jewish leaders, a major Vatican document on the Holocaust is ready. The Vatican said Saturday that the document, produced by the Commission for Relations with Judaism, would be made public on Monday. Jewish groups worldwide have been keenly awaiting the document to see if it will continue to heal Jewish-Catholic relations and have at times issued calls for its release to be speeded up. The last Vatican document of landmark proportions on Jewish relations was a 1965 statement that came out of the Second Vatican Council under Paul VI. \"Nostra Aetate\" (In Our Times) condemned anti-Semitism and said the Jews cannot be collectively blamed for the crucifixion of Jesus. {{John Paul II}} has dedicated much of {{John Paul II}} nearly 20-year -old papacy to improving relations of the church with Jews, whom he refers to as \"older brothers,\" after centuries of animosity. Word of the latest document first came on Sept. 1, 1987, during a meeting between the pope and Jewish leaders in Castel Gandolfo, the pontiff's summer residence in the hills southeast of Rome. The unprecedented meeting was hurriedly called as anxiety built in the Vatican that Jews might boycott a ceremony during the then soon-approaching papal visit to the United States. Jews were angered by the pope's audience earlier that year with then Austrian President {{Kurt Waldheim}}, who was been accused of helping deport Jews to Nazi concentration camps, allegations {{Kurt Waldheim}} denied. The Castel Gandolfo meeting was the first time Jewish representatives had sat down for informal discussions with a pope. Representatives at the 1987 meeting said the Vatican planned to publish a major document dealing with anti-Semitism and the genocide of European Jews by the Nazis in World War II. Since that meeting, {{John Paul II}} has presided over several milestones that improved relations with Jews, including the establishment of diplomatic relations with Israel in 1995. The agreement to go ahead and forge ties came in December 1993. Another ground-breaking step was the pope's visit to Rome's main synagogue in 1986. Last fall, the pope told a Vatican seminar on anti-Jewish currents in Christian theology that centuries of anti-Jewish prejudice had figured in \"deadening\" Christian resistance toe the Nazi persecution of Jews. But, to the disappointment of some Jewish groups, the pope steered clear of blaming the church itself. (fd)"

        "BEIJING (AP) _ A small and secretive Chinese opposition party has ambitious goals: bringing free elections, political democracy and greater civil liberties than currently allowed by the ruling Communist Party, a Beijing -based member of the underground group says. The 29-year -old member of the China Democratic Justice Party stopped short of saying that they want to see the communists overthrown. Instead, he said they wanted to be able to compete on an equal footing with them in elections and \"let the people decide who rules.\" \"When we unite, we won't just be a few hundred or a few thousand people. We'll be able to grow into several million people, several tens of million,\" he said in an interview, the first by a China -based member of the group. \"We'll be like the Polish Solidarity union movement, a nationwide civil power.\" The organization announced its formation last month in faxes to foreign reporters in Beijing. It said it was headquartered with exiled Chinese dissidents in the United States and had members in China. Until now, however, there had been no way of confirming the group's existence with members inside China. The group is the first known opposition party organized by dissidents in China and overseas. But, forced to operate secretly in small cells, it does not for the moment appear to present any obvious threat to the communists ' nearly 50-year rule. China's constitution allows for freedom of association and other liberties. But working to change the communist -run system is illegal, and the party relentlessly punishes dissent. Thus, party members in China work in small cells that operate independently of each other to avoid detection, the party member said. He identified himself as Chen Jin, a pseudonym he said he has used when signing petitions to the government calling for democratic change. He was generally circumspect about his own history. He said he grew up in northeast China, studied in Beijing, where he works as a business manager, and took part in democracy protests in 1989 that started on Beijing's Tiananmen Square and spread to other cities. He said there were 17 members in his party cell, one of three in Beijing. The other members range in age and include university students, government bureaucrats, professors, two laborers and a lawyer, he said. He estimated the two other cells in Beijing have a similar number of members. Another cell operates in Changchun and another is planned in Harbin, he said. Both cities are in China's northeast, where dissatisfaction over layoffs at run-down state firms is mounting. According to New York -based dissident {{Fu Shenqi}}, {{Fu Shenqi}}, the party has at least 100 members in five to 10 branches in provinces and cities across China. The party's demands include freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom to protest, freedom of the press, and freedom to set up opposition parties, the Beijing -based member said. \"We all have a common conviction _ bringing political diversification and political democracy to China,\" he said. Asked how the party would recruit members, he described a somewhat vague process whereby party members would start by chatting to ordinary Chinese _ he mentioned taxi drivers, factory workers, entrepreneurs and soldiers _ about issues of public concern. These could include official corruption within the party and government, layoffs, or other sources of dissatisfaction that have arisen in China's two-decade shift from a planned to a market economy. Through such contacts they would look for suitable people to join the party, he said. \"If after one meeting, two meetings, many meetings, we discover that they think like us and are willing to operate in an organization, then they will become a target for us,\" he said. \"When we are strong, the Communist Party will have lost its ruling base, the army won't carry out its orders,\" he added. \"At that time, we'll use negotiations to resolve the problems in society.\""

        "ROME (AP) _ Twenty years after terrorists kidnapped former Premier {{Aldo Moro}} and left {{Aldo Moro}} bullet-riddled body in the back of a parked car, one question still haunts Italy : Could {{Aldo Moro}} have been saved? The anniversary of the kidnapping is being marked by television programs, new books, a play and published interviews with convicted members of the Red Brigades who took part in the crime. But the ex-terrorists have only added fuel to the debate about the assassination, which became the defining moment in Italy's reign of terrorism in the 1970s and early 80s. {{Aldo Moro}} was abducted in Rome on March 16, 1978, in an ambush that killed five of his bodyguards. {{Aldo Moro}} body turned up 55 days later in a car parked around the corner from the headquarters of both the Christian Democrat and Communist parties. {{Aldo Moro}} had just negotiated an agreement for the Communists and Christian Democrats, the leading political forces in Italy at that time, to collaborate. It was a historic agreement, a break with the long-standing policy backed by the United States to keep Western Europe's largest communist party away from power. Those political parties no longer exist, done in by scandals and an end to the Cold War that also took the bite out of the ideological divisions that so marked Italian society during the years of bullets and bombs. The kidnapping and slaying stiffened Italy's resolve to fight domestic terrorism, marking the beginning of the end to urban guerrilla gangs in the country. Then-premier {{Giulio Andreotti}}, like Moro a Christian Democrat and now on trial on charges of favoring the mafia, insisted earlier this month that the government did everything it could. \"To {{Aldo Moro}}, we activated everybody, including the armed forces,\" {{Giulio Andreotti}} said in a roundtable organized by the {{Corriere della Sera}} newspaper. The government stuck to hard-line policy, refusing any compromise, such as freeing terrorist prisoners despite {{Aldo Moro}} increasingly desperate pleas. {{Mario Moretti}}, convicted as the triggerman, was quoted as saying that \"just a signal, the recognition of the existence of political prisoners\" would have been enough. \"Instead, no one knew the right thing to do and we made a mistake. We all made a mistake,\" {{Mario Moretti}} was quoted as saying by the weekly Vita. But {{Anna Braghetti}}, another former Red Brigade member, gave a different version, saying the decision to kill {{Aldo Moro}} came after a poll among 200 members of the gang. The group could not justify sparing {{Aldo Moro}} life, given that the government was not compromising and so many of {{Aldo Moro}} bodyguards were killed in an attempt to kidnap {{Aldo Moro}}, {{Anna Braghetti}} was quoted as saying by {{Corriere della Sera}}. Attempts to close the dark chapter of the \"years of lead\" _ as the terrorist period is called _ by an amnesty for those convicted of terrorist crimes have been stalled in parliament. Opposition is strong to clemency for \"blood crimes\" like the {{Aldo Moro}} killing."

        "BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas attacked Israeli forces in southern Lebanon on Saturday while civilians flocked to rallies around the country to mark 20 years of Israeli occupation. Lebanon's president, prime minister and national assembly speaker held talks with Syrian leaders in Damascus on Israel's proposal to withdraw its 1,500 troops from southern Lebanon. The talks were seen as aimed at coordinating the Lebanese and Syrian views ahead of a visit by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. Both Beirut and Damascus have already rejected Jerusalem's proposal, which makes a withdrawal conditional on Lebanese guarantees that guerrillas would not attack northern Israel. Guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah group mounted attacks on positions of Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone, Lebanese officials said. There was no word on casualties. Hezbollah and the Hezbollah -backed Lebanese Resistance Brigades said in statements issued here that their guerrillas had attacked positions at Sojod, Hardon, Baarchit, Hadatha and Soweida. Thousands turned out for rallies in Beirut, and the cities of Sidon and Tyre and the town of Nabatiyeh in the south. In Sidon, the capital of southern Lebanon, local politicians such as the prime minister's sister, legislator Bahia Hariri, denounced Israel's occupation and called for the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425. Passed in 1978, the resolution calls on Israel to withdraw its forces from Lebanon. Speakers vowed that guerrillas would continue their \"resistance\" against Israeli forces until the occupation ended. In Beirut, legislator Mohammed Beydoun, warned the crowd that Israel might attack Lebanon again \"with the aim of torpedoing resolution 425.\" A group calling itself the March 14 Solidarity Day with Occupied Southern Lebanon published a full-page advertisement in The Daily Star which described the world's failure to make Israel comply with resolution 425 as a \"record of disgrace.\" It was on March 14, 1978, that some 25,000 Israeli troops invaded south Lebanon in a campaign against Palestinian guerrillas, who had attacked a town in northern Israel. Five days later, the Security Council adopted Resolution 425. Huge yellow banners hung across intersections in Beirut where motorists strung yellow ribbons from their aerials. In Lebanon, yellow is the symbol of support for resolution 425. In the eastern city of Baalbek, government buildings sported yellow banners and Hezbollah supporters roamed the streets soliciting funds for \"the resistance.\" Outside the city, Hezbollah activists burned Israel's flag on the main road. Thousands of Lebanese civilians and militants and nearly 900 Israeli soldiers have been killed since 1978. Since 1985 Israel has occupied a strip of land along the border amounting to 10 percent of Lebanese territory. Israel, which maintains the strip with some 2,500 local militiamen, says the zone is a necessary buffer against guerrilla attacks. But increasing casualties _ a record 39 Israeli troops were killed in action in Lebanon last year _ have generated grassroots pressure among Israelis for the government to make a unilateral withdrawal."

        "JERUSALEM (AP) _ A man was seriously injured Saturday in an explosion outside the bus station in the small northern Israeli town of Afula, an ambulance official said. The blast blew off both the man's hands, Israeli army radio quoted Eli Bin, deputy head of the Afula ambulance station, as saying. The man appeared to be in his early 50s, the radio said. Police said the explosion took place in a public park just outside the bus station. Before the man was taken into surgery, he said he had spotted a cardboard box that he thought looked suspicious and was examining it when it exploded, army radio said. Israeli police frequently tell people to be on the alert for suspicious objects that might be bombs planted by Palestinian militant groups. However, police always urge the public not to touch any such objects, but to report them to the nearest police station. The Afula bus station was the scene of a major terror attack in April 1994, when a car rigged with explosives blew up, killing nine people and injuring 45. The militant Muslim group Hamas claimed responsibility. When Saturday's blast occurred, however, the bus station was nearly deserted. There is no public transport in most Israeli cities on the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday."

        "UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Recalling U.N. failures in Africa, Security Council members said Friday the international community must demonstrate the political will to help Africa overcome its economic and social problems. The calls came during an all-day debate on Africa to review Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report last week, in which he outlined goals for the United Nations in assisting the world's most under-developed continent. In that report, {{Kofi Annan}}, the first sub-Saharan African to head the United Nations, said African leaders must demonstrate the political will to combat corruption, protect human rights and pursue sound economic policies. At the same time, {{Kofi Annan}} said, the international community must respond by investing in Africa and by intervening to end armed conflicts and restore stability. Echoing {{Kofi Annan}} comments, {{Antonio Monteiro}}, {{Antonio Monteiro}}, said \"political will is needed from the international community\" to help Africa overcome its political problems. \"And will and courage is very much needed to avoid future situations in which the United Nations is unfortunately seen to have turned its back on the African people,\" {{Antonio Monteiro}} said. \"Concrete measures should be considered to ensure that the United Nations and the Security Council in particular provide a timely response to impending crises.\" But the council's willingness to intervene in African crises was weakened by the disastrous failure of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Somalia in 1993. The deaths of 18 American soldiers in a gunbattle in Mogadishu in 1993 led the United States to withdraw from the operation and impose stringent conditions on future U.N. peacekeeping missions. U.N. officials have complained those conditions have made it nearly impossible for the United Nations to respond quickly to African crises. They point to the U.S. stand as one of the main reasons for the laggard U.N. response to the 1994 massacre of up to a half million Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists. The Security Council was also unable to intervene decisively in last year's rebellion in the Congo, formerly Zaire, and in the Republic of Congo, where a former dictator overthrew an elected president. \"The experience of intervention in Somalia was a bitter one but that of non-intervention in Rwanda was perhaps worse,\" {{John Weston}} told the council. He cited the U.N. success in supervising the transition of Eastern Slavonia from Serb to Croat control as an example of how the United Nations could be effective \"given the right mandates and resources.\" {{John Weston}} said proposals for shifting peacekeeping to regional organizations _ as proposed by the Clinton Administration _ \"cannot substitute for the U.N.\" \"What we need is an active partnership with Africa,\" {{John Weston}} said. {{Alain Dejammet}}, {{Alain Dejammet}}, said France was \"prepared to respond and work\" with its U.N. partners on a more effective role in Africa, despite the French drawdown of military forces on the continent. The Security Council asked {{Kofi Annan}} to prepare the report following a meeting on Africa held in September during the annual General Assembly debate. The United States sought the meeting to draw international attention to the problems facing Africa. {{Kofi Annan}} said {{Kofi Annan}} would deliver that message during a visit to eight African countries _ Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Eritrea _ starting Wednesday."

NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC. {{Shah Alam}}, Thurs. - The Selangor Waterworks Department and the police have stepped up investigations into the alleged theft of water by a company, Sun Metal Works Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of Wembley Industries Holdings Bhd, at Jalan Gambus off Jalan Bukit Kemuning in Klang. The company involved in metal works and production of boilers is expected to be charged soon under section 38 of the Water Supply Act 1997 which carries a maximum fine of RM50,000 or two years ' jail or both. If the company continues stealing water in spite of the directive to stop doing so, it will be fined RM1,000 a day. {{Shah Alam}} district crime chief, Deputy Superintendent G. Selvakumar said police have stepped up their investigations under section 379 of the Penal Code. The company, which has about 400 permanent and contract employees, has been in operation at the site for about two years. {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} today said apart from court action, the State Waterworks Department had been directed to recover payment, estimated to be about half-a million ringgit, from the company. \"It is a serious offence to steal water and the company has been doing this from the time it has been in operation at the site with an average of 450,000 litres of water a day,\" {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} told reporters after opening the 11th Selangor Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry annual general meeting at Radisson Hotel. The courts, {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} added, should also impose deterrent sentences on those charged with theft of water. {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} said the department has also been ordered to act immediately on all information received from the public on theft of water by squatters, individuals and the commercial sector as it could cost the Government millions of ringgit. Asked why the department did not act on complaints lodged by the public earlier on theft of water, {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} said he would check with the authorities but assured the public that all complaints would be acted upon effective from today. \"The public can also lodge complaints with the State Technical Committee on Water headed by State Secretary {{Datuk Hashim Meon}} or to my office,\" he added. {{Datuk Hashim Meon}} said the State Government was considering giving rewards to those with information on theft of water. \"With the present water crisis, every drop of water counts,\" {{Datuk Hashim Meon}} said adding that the water rationing exercise was being implemented as planned in all affected areas in Zone A and B. Meanwhile employees at Sun Metal Works Sdn Bhd when interviewed said that the factory had been deprived of water supply for the past two days. Attempts to contact the factory officials proved futile."

NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC. PEOPLE from across the world travel to Cherating on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia mainly because Club Med has made it famous. However, Cherating, as many a visitor knows, is more than just Club Med. Within a short radius of Pahang's top beach spot, you can find many lovely things to do or see. My second visit to Cherating recently unveiled more places that I hadn't been to before. It was a weekend well spent; delighting in the greenery, soaking up the sun and enjoying the leisurely life by the seaside. My two friends from Singapore and I stayed at The Legend Resort, Cherating, 47km north of Kuantan or 45 minutes from Kuantan airport. If you prefer to drive, it's about five hours from Kuala Lumpur. At Cherating, there is a wide range of accommodation to choose from. Depending on your budget, there are top-notch resorts like The Legend, Impiana, Residence Inn, Holiday Villa Cherating and the new Swiss Garden, or the affordable chalets rented out by village folks. Foreigners can also arrange for homestay with locals, for a fee, of course. One of the first places we visited was a fishing village in Kuala Kemaman, on the Terengganu side of the border. Our plan to buy fresh fish did not materialise as Friday was a day of rest for the fishermen. Undeterred, we drove around Cukai, a tiny town in Terengganu that's bursting with banks (our guide Santhi Jayadhan counted at least a dozen) that service the oil and gas industries. {{Santhi Jayadhan}}, has been living in the area for several years and knows the place like the back of {{Santhi Jayadhan}} hand. Next, we arranged to have a tour of the famous Club Med and noted with delight that there is a soon-to-be-opened turtle sanctuary and information centre beside the resort. This means city folks like me don't have to travel to Rantau Abang to see how turtles are hatched. The following day, we spent an enjoyable morning on a small, uninhabited island and the afternoon at Cherating village, arranged by the hotel. However, {{Wan Yeh Mahmood}} seemed so enthusiastic that we couldn't possibly chicken out. As it turned out, the sea was calm and beautiful, and Pulau Ular (there are no snakes there) was great as a picnic spot. With only a stamp-sized patch of beach, the rocky Pulau Ular is better suited for fishing and snorkelling. The water was so clear that tiny fish could be seen swimming near some of the rocks. While we frolicked in the water, {{Wan Yeh Mahmood}} and the boatman took the sampan out for a spot of fishing. We were pleased when {{Wan Yeh Mahmood}} gave us {{Wan Yeh Mahmood}} catch of a few medium- and small-sized fish. {{Wan Yeh Mahmood}} later arranged for one of the resort's chefs to cook the fish in three styles: steamed, deep-fried, and prepared with delicious ayam percik sauce. According to {{Kevin Loh}}, {{Kevin Loh}}, the resort's chefs are always willing to help guests, particularly long-staying ones, to cook their catch after a fishing trip or after a visit to the fishing village. A trip to the older part of Cherating village - with its kampung-style chalets, pubs, restaurants and handicraft workshops and where you can see Mak De's chalet-cum-restaurant - is not to be missed. \"Mak Long De,\" said {{Santhi Jayadhan}}, \"is an enterprising housewife who set up the first chalet for rent to tourists in the early '60s, about 20 years before Club Med came into the scene.\" We didn't get to see Mak Long De but we chatted with her relative, {{Pak De}}, a sprightly septuagenarian who has trained {{Pak De}} monkey called \"Salleh\" to pluck coconuts to amuse tourists and for sale. The three-year -old berok can pick over 200 coconuts in a day. {{Pak De}} said it takes {{Pak De}} between one and two months to train a monkey. {{Pak De}} charges RM10 for the monkey to \"perform\" and RM1 for a coconut. To get a feel of how some locals earn a living, you can also watch village folks make gula melaka or brown sugar, and visit the Cherating Handicraft Centre where women gather to weave mengkuang (pandunus) leaves before fashioning them into pretty and functional items like mats, visors, bags, slippers, letter-holders, baskets, coasters and hand-held fans. One of the latest tourist attractions in the area is the Cherating Cultural Complex, a one-stop cultural centre where you can watch craftsmen and women painting batik, weaving mengkuang and tenun, or see a demonstration of traditional games like top-spinning, kite-flying, congkak and sepak raga. Or dine at the restaurant in the complex while enjoying a wayang kulit play or a traditional dance. Run by the Kuantan Municipal Council, the RM1 million complex is spread over 1.6ha near the Cherating River. It had its soft opening last June and is still being expanded. Our three-day getaway in Cherating finished off with a morning cruise on the Cherating River. I've never ceased to be amazed at the diversity and richness of Malaysia's flora and fauna. We saw within just a 30-minute ride up and down a portion of Cherating River a few kingfishers, an iguana, pheasants, monkeys, an eagle and spiders, and enjoyed the natural music created by cicadas and many birds. Thank goodness we don't have to travel half -way across the world to savour these simple pleasures of life."

        "SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a mosque in central San'a Friday, killing three people and wounding 27 others, security officials said. The explosion occurred inside the al-Khair Mosque as scores of Muslims were performing Friday prayers, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. The injured included two U.S. citizens, a Dutch, a Canadian and several Africans _ all Muslims who were praying in the mosque at the time of the explosion. At least ten of the injured were in critical condition, the officials said. No one took responsibility for the explosion. Yemen, a poor nation of around 17 million on the Arabian peninsula, is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and the socialist south. The government says subsequent acts of violence were directed from abroad, but it has not named any country."

        "NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ After 10 days of seemingly endless negotiations, fears and dashed hopes, the leader of hostages released in Somalia Friday said he burst into tears when gunmen set him and his nine colleagues free. \"We've gone through ups and downs,\" {{Thomas Gurtner}} said. \"We are a group of 10 people, different nationalities, different cultural backgrounds, but we stuck it out together in a quite amazing way. We had some difficult moments, but in the end we survived it.\" Relieved relatives cheered and hugged {{Thomas Gurtner}} and nine others when they stepped off the Red Cross aircraft from Mogadishu. Other captives included Norwegian Ola Skuterud ; naturalized American Somali Ibrahim Ahmad ; Belgian Toon Vandenhove ; German Christoph Langenkamp ; Swiss Patrick Berner and Markus Fasel ; and French nurse Nadine Piantowsky. {{Robi Byrd}}, {{Robi Byrd}} also were released. The 10 were kidnapped along with a Somali aid worker by renegade gunmen on April 15 as soon as their plane touched down in north Mogadishu. From then on, Somali elders and leaders, apparently embarrassed by the abductions and worried about their impact on the fragile peace process, were in daily contact with the captors. At one point, the kidnappers demanded up to one million dollars. At the end, no ransom was paid and the hostages were set free unconditionally, according to the Red Cross and {{Ali Mahdi Mohamed}}. Bill Grant, a Somali advisor and a former U.S. congressman from Florida, said three families from the Abgal subclan staged the kidnapping because they felt they were excluded from the distribution of international aid. Aid workers and foreigners have been kidnapped in Somalia by militiamen eager to make easy money since the country disintegrated into a fiefdom of clans following the ouster of late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. In the past, aid agencies have refused to pay ransoms, for fear of causing more Inside a walled north Mogadishu compound, the hostages were unaware of the course negotiations were taking, but kept their faith throughout, {{Thomas Gurtner}} said. \"Hope was always there,\" {{Thomas Gurtner}} said. \"We were treated as hostages. We were confined to a single room, 20 square meters (200 square feet) for 10 of us. But we always had access to water, food and sanitary facilities. Apart from a very few tense moments, generally speaking, we've been treated with respect.\" He blamed an international TV crew, which he did not name, for creating unnecessary tensions. \"They forced their entrance into the compound and actually used some of the militiamen, almost inciting them to create the most dramatic affect,\" he said. \"There, I thought I was not going to survive. The press has very seriously affected the dignity of all us.\" The news of the release came after a night of anxiety and last-minute bickering among the captors, he said. \"The moment we came out of the room, when we saw colleagues from the Somali Red Crescent who came to pick us up, and once {{Thomas Gurtner}} was in the car and the car started moving, {{Thomas Gurtner}} burst out crying,\" {{Thomas Gurtner}} said. \"It was a total moment of relief.\" The freed hostages appeared in good shape and there were no indications that they had been physically harmed. In Mogadishu, all three Somali faction leaders as well as clan elders came to congratulate the group on the release. {{Ali Mahdi Mohamed}}, a Somali leader from north Mogadishu, apologized for their ordeal on behalf of Somalis.

        "MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Switzerland signed an agreement Friday pledging to combine efforts to prevent Russian organized crime from laundering profits in Swiss banks. The memorandum, signed in Moscow by Swiss Federal Prosecutor {{Carla del Ponte}} and Russian Prosecutor General {{Yuri Skuratov}}, calls for sharing information about organized crime suspects and about banks involved in laundering or accepting deposits of illegal profits. There have been frequent reports that Russian organized crime uses Swiss banks to launder criminal profits running to hundreds of millions of dollars.

NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC. THE Companies Act 1965 needs to be amended to check against the unhealthy activities of non-governmental organisations operating under the disguise of companies. Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade and {{Datuk S. Subramaniam}} told the Dewan Rakyat that some of these NGOs were found to be carrying out activities not in the interest of the public or national security. Tabling the Companies (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 1997 for a second reading, he said a new section had been proposed to empower the Registrar of Companies to refuse registration of the memorandum of a proposed company if he was satisfied that it was likely to be used for unlawful purposes, or any purpose prejudicial to or incompatible with peace, welfare, security, public order, good order or morality, or prejudicial to national security or public interest. The amendments also seek to provide additional grounds for the courts to compulsorily wind up a company if it is being used as specified above. {{Datuk S. Subramaniam}} said the amendments were also aimed at ensuring companies would be more responsible in matters pertaining to their accounts. As the accounts have to be made out in accordance with approved accounting standards with certain exceptions, they would be able to reflect the real performance of the companies. During the debate, {{Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang}} felt suitable measures must be introduced to help companies facing problems due to economic uncertainties. {{Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang}} proposed that creditors and management of companies find an amicable solution to overcome their financial difficulties. {{Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang}} said the ROC needed to improve its services and administration, and one way this could be achieved was through its corporatisation. Lim Kit Siang (DAP - Tanjung) focused his debate on one of his favourite topics - questioning the Government on its move to bail out companies now in difficulties due to economic problems. Reiterating his stand that the various corporate exercises involving companies like Malaysia Airlines, Renong, Konsortium Perkapalan, United Engineers Malaysia and others were actually attempts to rescue companies which had connections with the Government, {{Lim}} proposed that a commission be established to handle the task. \"If bailing-out is to become a government policy, set up this commission where everyone can submit their applications for them to be vetted fairly, regardless of whether they are big or small companies, with or without connections.\" {{Lim}} also questioned Ekran Bhd's move in using proceeds from a rights issue although it differed from the original intended purpose, saying the case would be a test to the performance of the regulatory authorities. The Opposition leader said he did not object to the amendments but hoped the additional powers would not be used to silence NGOs from criticising government policies or actions. {{Husni Hanadzlah}} hoped the proposed amendments would enhance the responsibility of the board of directors towards shareholders and ensure non-abuse of power. On audit committees, the MP said a study should be conducted to ensure all public companies adhered to the regulation to hold audit committee meetings four times a year. {{Husni Hanadzlah}} said the amendment would also ensure the authenticity of documents filed or lodged by the Registrar. {{Husni Hanadzlah}} praised the move to enable documents required under the Act to be electronically filed or lodged with the Registrar but said the information provided must not be outdated. In lauding the proposed amendments, Michael Lisa Kaya (BN - Bukit Mas) said the proposed inclusion of Section 11(a) was a good move in keeping abreast of national development and the Government's aspirations in information technology. The proposed amendment would see the insertion of this section for electronic filing of documents. The Registrar may provide a service for the electronic filing or lodging of documents. The MP said NGOs would be prevented from misleading the public and causing disharmony with the introduction of the amendment. Citing {{Sahabat Alam Malaysia}}, the MP questioned its motives in playing a role in the setting up of human blockades in Sarawak in 1991. \"Instead of inciting the natives, why don't they just educate them by holding seminars,\" {{Sahabat Alam Malaysia}} asked.

Mentakab MP Fu Ah Kiow also supported the proposed amendment to introduce electronic filing and said this would help in streamlining the efficiency of the ROC's documentation process. {{M. Kulasegaran}} raised the issue of golf clubs which offered transferable memberships, citing the Kelab Golf Darul Ridzuan in Perak as an example. {{M. Kulasegaran}} said the club, formerly known as the Meru Valley Golf Club, had also offered lots priced at between RM120,000 and RM150,000 each. Local members were charged monthly fees while it was waived for international members. {{M. Kulasegaran}} urged the ROC to conduct stringent inspections over such clubs nationwide. {{Datuk S.

SIXTY-FIVE of the 69 Commonwealth member countries have confirmed their participation in the 16th Commonwealth Games in September, Deputy Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Loke Yuen Yow told the House. He said this in response to Hashim Ismail (BN - Ledang), who asked whether all the Commonwealth countries would be participating in the Games and whether the Government, in its capacity as host of the second largest international games event, was satisfied with all aspects of the preparations carried out so far. On the athletes' training programme, he said it had entered the fourth phase since early this year. Under this phase, 272 athletes would undergo full-time training schedules. The schedules are supervised by 42 foreign coaches who are assisted by 35 local coaches. He said though in 1992, only badminton salvaged national pride, weight lifting, shooting, gymnastics and bowling are expected to bring Malaysia medals this year. To a supplementary question from Lim Kit Siang (DAP - Tanjung), Loke said the Government had spent about 53 per cent of the RM2 billion allocated for hosting the Games. The Opposition leader had questioned the rationale in accepting MAS Catering's offer of providing food for the athletes at RM120 per day per athlete, taking into consideration current economic conditions."

        "COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Denmark's largest industrial unions have rejected a wage proposal, setting the stage for a nationwide general strike, officials announced Friday. State mediator Asbjoern Jensen announced that 56 percent of those voting on the proposal turned it down. The rejection means a general strike is likely to begin on Monday, barring last-minute government intervention that could stave it off. {{Poul Nyrup Rasmussen}} rejected media speculation that a strike would force the postponement of the May 28 referendum on the European Union's Amsterdam treaty. A postponement had been widely expected in case of a strike. Many observers believed the government would not risk placing the treaty before Denmark's voters _ who are perpetually uneasy with the EU _ during a period of disorder. {{Poul Nyrup Rasmussen}} also said the government would not intervene in a strike. If a strike includes workers who stay off the job in sympathy with the unions who rejected the pact, an estimated 400,000 people could be involved. That could bring the country to a virtual halt. A general strike would quickly ramify throughout Europe. Copenhagen is the main air transport hub for the Nordic region and Denmark is the primary route for Norwegian and Swedish exports to reach the rest of Europe. \"The strike came out of the blue,\" said {{Ask Hamstrup}}, {{Ask Hamstrup}}. \"This means that we have to hamster,\" he said, referring to the rodents' practice of storing food in their cheeks. The Central Organization of Industrial Employees members' rejection of the two-year wage pact came as a surprise. Most observers had expected the unions would approve the compromise agreement worked out in March with the Confederation of Danish Industries. The package included an extra paid day off, pension contributions increasing by 0.9 percent per year and the minimum wage would increase by 2 kroner (28 cents) over the next two years. The minimum wage is 76.40 kroner (dlrs 10.6) an hour."

        "UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members said Friday the international community must demonstrate the political will to help Africa overcome its economic and social problems. The calls came during an all-day debate on Africa to review Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report last week, in which he outlined goals for the United Nations in assisting the world's most under-developed continent. {{Kofi Annan}}, the first sub-Saharan African to head the United Nations, said that African leaders must be willing to combat corruption, protect human rights and pursue sound economic policies. At the same time, {{Kofi Annan}} said, the international community must respond by investing in Africa and by intervening to end armed conflicts and restore stability. Echoing {{Kofi Annan}} comments, {{Antonio Monteiro}}, {{Antonio Monteiro}}, said \"political will is needed from the international community\" to help Africa overcome its political problems. \"And will and courage is very much needed to avoid future situations in which the United Nations is unfortunately seen to have turned its back on the African people,\" {{Antonio Monteiro}} said. \"Concrete measures should be considered to ensure that the United Nations and the Security Council in particular provide a timely response to impending crises.\" But the council's willingness to intervene in African crises was weakened by the disastrous failure of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Somalia. The deaths of 18 American soldiers in a gun battle in 1993 led the United States to withdraw from the Somali operation and impose stringent conditions on future U.N. peacekeeping missions. U.N. officials have complained those conditions have made it nearly impossible for the United Nations to respond quickly to African crises. They point to the U.S. stand as a major reason for the laggard U.N. response to the 1994 massacre of up to 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists. \"The experience of intervention in Somalia was a bitter one but that of non-intervention in Rwanda was perhaps worse,\" British Ambassador John Weston told the council. He cited the U.N. success in supervising the transition of Eastern Slavonia from Serb to Croat control as an example of how the United Nations could be effective \"given the right mandates and resources.\" The Security Council asked {{Kofi Annan}} to prepare the report following a meeting on Africa held in September. On Wednesday, {{Kofi Annan}} begins a tour of eight African countries _ Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Eritrea."

        "LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ An explosion has rocked the southwestern university town of Ife killing at least six people, Radio Lagos reported Friday. Initial reports said the explosion late Thursday night had occurred in the nearby city of Ilesha, about 200 kilometers (125 miles) northeast of the commercial capital Lagos. Several other people were wounded. The cause of the blast was not given, but the radio report said it was similar to an explosion one night earlier that killed three people in a Lagos suburb. The town's military governor on Friday inspected the site of the explosion in Ife, but few details were made public. Authorities have not said whether either explosion was caused by a bomb, but church leaders and opponents of Nigeria's ruling military junta have warned of violence if the army does not step down from power. Thursday's blast came just days before nationwide voting in legislative elections _ part of a transition process from military to civilian rule in Nigeria. Opponents have called the transition a sham and have vowed to boycott voting in Saturday's legislative polls and in presidential elections later this year. Bomb experts in Lagos, meanwhile, were sifting through debris from a blast Wednesday night that left a huge crater in a residential street. Victims in that explosion were outside watching a soccer match on a television that had been placed in a neighbor's yard when the explosion occurred. Hours earlier, a senior Roman Catholic leader warned of violence in Nigeria if {{Sani Abacha}} becomes president later this year. {{Sani Abacha}}, a devout Muslim, has very little support in the country's south, where Christians say they face discrimination and repression from the military junta. Opposition and pro-democracy groups are outraged at the recent unanimous presidential nominations of Abacha by Nigeria's five political parties. Most of {{Sani Abacha}} opponents have said the nomination process was rigged to eliminate any competition. Presidential elections will now take the form of a referendum to vote for or against {{Sani Abacha}} uncontested nomination. Abacha seized power in a bloodless 1993 coup and has since faced international criticizing for rampant human rights abuses and refusing to hand power over to a civilian government."

        "LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Ranging in price from dlrs 18 for the cheapest first-round seat to dlrs 100 for the most expensive place at the final, tickets for the 1999 Women's World Cup go on sale Friday. Just as for the 1994 men's World Cup, the sale will be in stages with tickets initially available only to the \"U.S. Soccer Family\" from May 1 - 31. People purchasing tickets then will receive 5 - 15 percent discount. Members of U.S. Soccer Family include members of the U.S. federation, its affiliated organizations, and those whose who have purchased tickets or expressed interest in a U.S. national team game over approximately the past four years. Tickets for the general public will be placed on sale in the fall at date yet to be determined. All tickets at first will have to be purchased in a series, meaning an individual must buy a ticket for each World Cup event at a particular venue, including including quarterfinals and semifinals. A date for single-game sales have not been announced. At the 1994 World Cup, initial sales required individuals to buy tickets for all first- and second-round games at a particular venue. Except for the semifinals, all Women's World Cup events are doubleheaders, including the final, which will be preceeded by the third-place game. That squeezes the 32-game, 16-team tournament, scheduled for June 19 - July 10, 1999, into 17 dates. The least expensive series is dlrs 36 (dlrs 32 for the U.S. family) for the two first-round events at Chicago's Soldier field. The most expensive is dlrs 190 (dlrs 175 for the U.S. family) for the first-round, quarterfinals and semifinal at San Francisco - San Jose, California. About 500,000 tickets will be available, as compared to the approximately 2.5 million for the 1994 men's championship, when prices ranged from dlrs 25 for a first-round match to dlrs 475 for the best seat at the final."

The state news agency MTI reported the arrest of a man other media identified as {{Gabor Tanczos}}, who reportedly followed the girl home April 3.

Extra police were sent to the town to patrol. {{Gabor Tanczos}} was questioned by police. Contradictions in {{Gabor Tanczos}} account led investigators to take a closer look, when they found {{Gabor Tanczos}} fingerprints in the girl's home, MTI said.

        "For almost 20 years, since its debut in 1979, {{Bob Edwards}} has presided over the National Public Radio news magazine \"Morning Edition.\" But from the start, the soothing, avuncular tone that is {{Bob Edwards}} trademark raised certain questions. \"Isn't that man dangerous?\" a 10-year -old in the school car pool I was driving asked in 1980. I couldn't imagine what could be less dangerous. \"What are you talking about?\" I asked. \"It's early in the morning,\" she said. \"There are all these people driving around. He's going to make them all go back to sleep.\" Like a number of other high-profile NPR news-magazine hosts or news readers, {{Bob Edwards}} conveys a distinct sense of disengagement with the subjects {{Bob Edwards}} is presenting: the latest Serbian atrocities or an odd little cow-up-a-tree human-interest story from Iowa. It's a distance that translates into a sense of superiority over whatever is being talked about. It's shared by the \"All Things Considered\" hosts, {{Robert Siegel}}or}} as, year by year, day by day, they wend their way through the vagaries of events and time. What comes across is a sense of boredom with the world. With {{Bob Edwards}}, boredom might be the product. {{Bob Edwards}} is not remotely offensive; {{Bob Edwards}} is always patient. {{Bob Edwards}} sounds as if {{Bob Edwards}} has all the time in the world. Pleasantly, like a neighbor who drops in for coffee every morning at precisely the same time, {{Bob Edwards}} conveys the feeling that nothing can really surprise him. What could be more reassuring? On and on he drones, with little broadcasting pronunciation tics to keep your ear attuned to the blanket of syllables issuing from his mouth: a singsongy rhythm, pauses that break the rhythm, a warm, soft entrance into the next clause that restores the continuity. It begins to seem certain that nothing will ever change. Not only will the sun rise tomorrow, {{Bob Edwards}} performance says, it will rise tomorrow in exactly the same manner in which it rose today. Presidents, senators, representatives, sports heroes, film stars, flood victims: {{Bob Edwards}}, {{Bob Edwards}} tone says, was here before they got here, and {{Bob Edwards}}'ll be here when they are gone. Set forth in a less kindly manner, the same story is told by {{Robert Siegel}}or}}. {{Bob Edwards}} patience is replaced by impatience. The world will never change, these people are telling you, but, maddeningly, the world keeps pretending that it does change. The bored, contemptuous, irritated assumption seems to be that while, say, Bill Clinton is transitory, {{Robert Siegel}} or Ms. {{Linda Wertheimer}} _ and, by implication, the faithful NPR listener _ are permanent. This is often communicated on \"All Things Considered\" before and after any particular information or opinion. The White House correspondent, Mara Liasson, or the legal affairs correspondent, Nina Totenberg, may offer detailed, nuanced and, most importantly, involved reports. But with {{Robert Siegel}}, it is all translated into attitude. One can get the feeling that the bumper stickers on {{Robert Siegel}} cars would read \"I'd Rather Be Attending an Embassy Reception,\" if the very idea of a bumper sticker wasn't impossibly vulgar. {{Linda Wertheimer}} and the afternoon news reader, {{Ann Taylor}}, share the remarkable ability to look down their noses while talking through them. Speaking from NPR's Washington headquarters, they can make the rest of the country, even New York _ so ethnic, so exotic with local custom _ seem like a tired but mildly diverting play staged for their laconic amusement. {{Robert Siegel}} works differently. {{Robert Siegel}} speech is clipped, with words suddenly hurried or inexplicably dragged out, mumbled or swallowed: aural hooks, the equivalent of serifs on a type face, except that serifs don't call attention to themselves. There's a lot of {{Dick Cavett}}. {{Dick Cavett}}'s terribly earnest, while at the same time suggesting {{Dick Cavett}}'s not very interested. {{Dick Cavett}}'s like a well-prepared lawyer who seems never to ask a question to which {{Dick Cavett}} doesn't already know the answer. It's that denial of the chance of surprise that is so deadening. There is nothing new under the sun, least of all anything we might want to raise our voices over. Perhaps the most powerful moment of news reporting I ever experienced took place in 1978, on the night the news of the mass suicides and murders at Jonestown began to break. On television, on the evening network news show, the anchor summed up the facts as they were known, looked at the papers on his desk and, lowering his voice, spoke of \"this awful story.\" He broke the code of news broadcasting, the unspoken message that all things under the sun take place within the limits of what is already known, and it was shocking. That code is a lot of what NPR is selling. The antiphon to the cool school of NPR broadcasting is provided by {{Terry Gross}}. Ms. {{Terry Gross}}, 47, is the host and principal interviewer; speaking on the phone last week, {{Terry Gross}} guessed that since the program began more than 20 years ago, {{Terry Gross}} has done 9,000 or 10,000 interviews. Yet each one seems to begin a tale from the beginning. Though the show is conducted mostly by remote hookups, the atmosphere is invariably intimate and open. The feeling is that anything can happen; anything might be said. Ms. Gross is characteristically eager, but not naive. You hear enthusiasm in her voice, but also experience and skepticism. More often than not, people are on her show to sell their books, but she is doing the show to bring them, and what they are writing about, to life. She knows how to let people talk; she's not afraid of silences, or above a noisy \"Blech!\" when she's repulsed by a creepy story. She's dogged; she can give the impression that she will wait around all day if that's what it takes to get someone to stop faking. In a recent interview with {{Eddie Miller}}, {{Eddie Miller}} this is all true, one is supposed to believe, they just had to change the names _ Miller answered every other question with some variation of \"That's in the book.\" {{Eddie Miller}} spoke in a slow, gravelly, leering voice; as an armed robber, he said, {{Eddie Miller}} had lived \"the American dream in person.\" {{Eddie Miller}} met Ms. Gross ' questions with heavy sighs, as if to say: \"Where's this chick been all her life? Man, do {{Eddie Miller}} have to explain everything? It's in the book!\" Asked about how {{Eddie Miller}} felt while committing robbery, {{Eddie Miller}} began to laugh, with a smug insistence that {{Eddie Miller}} knew things Ms. Gross would never know. \"What's so funny?\" Ms. Gross asked in her high, pleasant, disarming voice _ a voice that in an instant had turned into a knife _ and finally {{Eddie Miller}} started talking. \"Fresh Air\" started as a local show in Philadelphia in 1975, Ms. Gross explained when we talked last week. It went national in 1985, daily in 1987. Just like \"American Bandstand,\" I said, thinking of {{Dick Clark}} 'n' roll dance party, perhaps {{Dick Clark}} to American broadcasting. \"Yeah!\" Ms. Gross said."

        "Cyberspace, only yesterday the proud Wild West of the information age, is rapidly being settled and tamed. The best evidence is a sudden _ and some might say alarming _ infestation by a new species, the cyberlawyers. They seem to be everywhere. Last month, at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference _ an annual gathering once dominated by hackers and security agents _ they clogged panels with subjects like \"Government jurisdiction over cyberspace transactions.\" Each week, they post hundreds of messages to their own \"Cyberia\" e-mail list, pondering matters like \"Usenet Death Penalty _ Legal?\" And a pack of cyberlawyers are petitioning the White House for access to its planned conference on Internet privacy. The nation's top law schools are vying to dominate an area of jurisprudence called cyberlaw, while law firms promoting such practices are becoming as ubiquitous as spam e-mail. And court dockets are swelling with digital-age disputes of \"first impression.\" Whatever happened to the electronic frontier? Perhaps, as they like to say in the legal trade, res ipsa loquitur _ the thing speaks for itself. The Internet has changed from a playground for like-minded libertarians to a workplace and social space for millions. The latest settlers have little interest in the cyberstate of nature or the utopian manifestoes of pioneers, like John Perry Barlow's oft-cited \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,\" which defied any state's assertion of control over the Internet. That is where the lawyers come in. \"It's like when you start a colony,\" said Mike Godwin, chief counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group that only a few years ago was practically alone in the field. \"The first thing you do is you find out where the water is. The next thing you do is form couples, start families. The notion of having law, which is a way to order social interactions, only happens after you have a lot of social interactions such that they become problematic.\" But in a legal system that reveres precedent and relies on analogy, even defining the nature of an Internet-related dispute can be a source of contention. Consider just a few of the pending cases and the questions they raise across a range of legal doctrines: _ The U.S. government sues Microsoft Corp., charging it with antitrust violations. How is monopoly measured in an information age? _ A White House aide, Sidney Blumenthal, sues {{Matt Drudge}}, {{Matt Drudge}}, for libel. What is the burden of proof and what are the remedies for libel on the Internet, where everyone can be a publisher? Moreover, can {{Matt Drudge}} be sued in the District of Columbia for an item that {{Matt Drudge}} posted on {{Matt Drudge}} World Wide Web site in Los Angeles? _ America Online sues for an injunction against multiple distributors of junk e-mail. Is such \"spam\" mail a violation of privacy? Would attempts to block it violate the First Amendment? _ A mathematics professor is suing the U.S. government for denying his application to send an encryption program over the Internet. Should the government be able to prevent him on national security grounds, or would that violate his free-speech rights? {{Cindy Cohn}}, the lawyer representing the math professor, said it was in part the lure of the unknown that made cyberspace law so appealing. \"It's a chance to think about first-level questions,\" said {{Cindy Cohn}}, {{Cindy Cohn}}. With this, you can say maybe you need to think in a new way about it.\" {{Cindy Cohn}} is scheduled to testify Tuesday before a Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee on proposed encryption legislation. Not everyone is as sanguine about the prospect of a clean legal slate. What is at stake, legal experts say, is whether the values that evolved over two centuries of case law will apply in cyberspace _ and what those decisions will teach us about the law in real space. \"There is anxiety, yes,\" said Judge {{Stewart Dalzell}}, {{Stewart Dalzell}}. Alluding to {{Stewart Dalzell}} role last year in overturning the Communications Decency Act, a landmark decision for cyberspace law that was later upheld by the Supreme Court, {{Stewart Dalzell}} recalled: \"{{Stewart Dalzell}} know going in that when {{Stewart Dalzell}} started to hear the testimony {{Stewart Dalzell}} went, 'Oh {{Stewart Dalzell}} God! Oh {{Stewart Dalzell}} God! {{Stewart Dalzell}} have to learn about packet switching?' And had we gone down the wrong path, it could have done immense mischief to the medium.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> As judges and lawyers search for metaphors, elite law schools are scurrying to stake their claims as the center of legal theory that will make sense of it all _ and to lure cutting-edge law professors and attract students eager to enter what looks to be a lucrative new field of practice. Earlier this month, Harvard Law School said it had received a $5.4 million donation from the estate of {{Lillian R. Berkman}}, an alumnus, and {{Lillian R. Berkman}} wife, {{Lillian R. Berkman}} to support its Center for Internet and Society, which was established last year and is overseen by {{Jonathan Zittrain}}, {{Jonathan Zittrain}}. Prof. {{Charles Nesson}}, {{Charles Nesson}}, said the money would be used in part to experiment with opening up the gates of the august institution to the general public. More than 1,000 people have enrolled in Privacy in Cyberspace, the center's first free no-credit course offered over the Internet. The gift will also endow a professorship. First to be named to the {{Lillian R. Berkman}} chair was {{Lawrence Lessig}}, whose appointment by a federal district judge as special master in the government's antitrust case against Microsoft did much to raise the profile of the nascent field of cyberspace legal theory. ({{Lawrence Lessig}} investigation has been suspended pending an appeals court decision on the propriety of {{Lawrence Lessig}} appointment.) Not to be outdone, Harvard's longtime rival, Yale Law School, made {{Lawrence Lessig}} a standing job offer as part of its effort to jump-start its Information Society Project. The school has offered visiting professorships to two intellectual property experts: {{James Boyle}}, {{James Boyle}} for Law and Technology at the University of California. \"Yale is going to be the place to be for cyberlaw,\" said {{Jack Balkin}}, {{Jack Balkin}}. \"What happened at Yale is, nobody came to us and said, 'Here's some money. Go found a technology center.' This was something we identified as a priority.\" Yale's stance is making other schools nervous. \"The competition has definitely heated up,\" said {{Pam Samuelson}}, who helped found Berkeley's center two years ago and hopes that {{Robert Mergess}} will stay put. {{Pam Samuelson}}, {{Pam Samuelson}}, said Berkeley's advantage was being in the midst of the industry that is creating so many of today's legal challenges. {{Pam Samuelson}} said that centers like Berkeley's would teach different skills and values than the traditional law school curriculum has taught. \"Rather than trying to develop fixed sets of black-letter law rules that you can memorize and then apply, this requires that students learn to be supple and adaptable,\" {{Pam Samuelson}} said. Although by most accounts Harvard, Yale and Berkeley have the strongest offerings, expertise in the field has spread. Michael Froomkin at the University of Miami has published several articles on law and cryptography, for example; {{Dan Burk}} is {{Dan Burk}}. {{David Post}}, {{David Post}} and now a professor at Temple University Law School, is at the center of an active debate among lawyers about whether the emergence of cyberspace requires a whole new legal model. \"There is a division between the incrementalists and the radicals,\" {{David Post}} said. \"To {{David Post}} it makes more sense to think of this as a separate domain of interaction that's going to have its own rules.\" The stress that the new technology places on existing law has provoked some scholars to argue that cyberspace needs laws of its own in areas like copyright and privacy. Others wonder whether at a time when private companies wield power over online behavior by computer code, constitutional principles should regulate private as well as state action. But many legal scholars scoff at the notion that cyberspace presents the need for a new discipline. Among them is {{Frank Easterbrook}} and a professor at the University of Chicago. In an article for the University of Chicago Law Review titled \"Cyberspace and the Law of the Horse,\" {{Frank Easterbrook}} warned of \"multidisciplinary dilettantism.\" A law of cyberspace makes about as much sense as a law of horses, {{Frank Easterbrook}} said. Still, even critics agree that the emergence of cyberspace is forcing the deepest and most critical consideration in years of law in general. \"Maybe dividing the world up into real space and cyberspace is artificial,\" said {{Brian Dally}}. \"What really came rushing to the fore for {{Brian Dally}} in {{Lawrence Lessig}} is that this should give us pause to examine some of our basic understandings about the purpose of government and the purpose of law.\""

        "Once upon a time, before the Internet had pictures and was all the rage, {{Quincy Jones}}, {{Quincy Jones}}, sat with {{Bill Gates}}, {{Bill Gates}}, at a technology conference, talking about the future. The year was 1992, and the conversation was a melding of the two titans' respective passions: the preservation of musical cultures and the nascent online universe that would become cyberspace. It took six years to realize a complete fusion of the vision that emerged that night. On Wednesday, {{Quincy Jones}} will introduce {{Qradio}}, a venture that marries the Internet to {{Quincy Jones}} advocacy of the rich, varied and largely unknown music of developing nations. \"Web radio,\" a technology that transmits audio programming to Internet-connected personal computers, offers the potential to reach a wide audience at a fraction of the cost of traditional broadcasting. \"It's a different sort of landscape, a 21st-century language,\" {{Quincy Jones}} said of the Internet. But while {{Quincy Jones}} site is devoted to music, unlike broadcast radio, it is not limited to sound. Rather, it is a multimedia product of which actual radio is only a part. Though it is being formally introduced this week, {{Qradio}} began in February with an initial focus on South Africa. It offers a data base of South African musicians, including biographies, discographies and sample clips, a multimedia history of musical evolution in the region and continuous feeds of three of South African Broadcasting Corp.'s 16 radio stations. {{Qradio}}, which was started with $5 million in private investments, plans to sell advertising, but it hopes to derive revenue from the sale of CDs and audio tapes marketed by means of online music samples. {{Quincy Jones}} say {{Quincy Jones}} hope eventually to broaden the site to embrace music from other parts of Africa, as well as from the Americas. Ultimately, it could serve as a medium for breeding new species of music, but for now, {{Quincy Jones}} suggests that the goal is to build bridges between cultures and technological classes. \"Here {{Quincy Jones}} are, entering the next century,\" {{Quincy Jones}} said. \"That number with three zeroes behind it is very heavy. It's ironic _ here {{Quincy Jones}} are dealing with the Internet and some of these people in South Africa don't have electricity.\" Adam Clayton Powell III, a lifelong friend and former employee of {{Quincy Jones}}, said the seed that germinated into {{Qradio}} was a 1991 trip that the two of them took to South Africa just as that nation's legacy of apartheid was collapsing. At the time, {{Adam Clayton Powell III}} said, the two men discussed the feasibility of a cable channel to promote the various indigenous musical cultures of the region, but the costs for such a venture were prohibitive. Even then, {{Adam Clayton Powell III}} said, the notion of using online technologies as a delivery mechanism piqued {{Quincy Jones}} interest. \"We have got to come back,\" to South Africa, {{Adam Clayton Powell III}}, {{Adam Clayton Powell III}}, recalls {{Adam Clayton Powell III}} friend saying. It would take the development of the World Wide Web and the technology known as streaming audio before the possibility of online radio transmission would be realized. But the technology alone cannot ensure that anyone will be listening, and industry analysts question whether a medium born in the 1920s will ever find an acceptable fit in the medium of the millennium. \"To put radio on the Internet is not what it's all about,\" said {{Alan Brody}}, {{Alan Brody}}. It's a cute idea, but that's not where the future is. The future is in personalizing what we hear on the radio.\" {{Adam Clayton Powell III}} disagreed. Now that virtually all new personal computers are equipped with audio capability, more people than ever will use the Web as a platform for radio-like programming. \"Radio is the most ubiquitous medium we have,\" {{Adam Clayton Powell III}} said. \"It's a form familiar to us as a species. We have a long tradition of oral history, and this fits that tradition.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> What is more, {{Qradio}} starts at a time when music is among the few real success stories in the online marketing efforts lumped together under the term electronic commerce. At-Plan, a marketing research firm, says its latest data show that CDs and tapes are the fifth-most-popular product sold on the Web, bought by 1.3 million people in the last quarter of 1997 and that more than 12 million people visit music-oriented Web sites in a typical 30-day period. The question with {{Qradio}}, as it is with many new online ventures, is whether enough visitors will frequent and shop at a niche Web site to make it financially viable. Distinguishing oneself in new media, experts in online broadcasting say, demands a delicate balancing act _ a product that is narrowly focused enough that an audience cannot get it elsewhere yet of broad enough appeal to support advertising and direct online sales. Many other players in the medium are embracing a more horizontal strategy. The print publishing group Imagine Media of Brisbane, Calif., which specializes in computer-oriented magazines, last week started a new Internet service called Imagine Radio, a group of 20 original radio stations created just for the Web. Audio Net, a Dallas -based company that has been in the streaming audio business for two and a half years, offers 260 radio and television stations from around the country, plus some 400 special events each day. \"When you're in your car you've got 30 radio stations,\" said {{Mark Cuban}}, {{Mark Cuban}}. \"On TV, there are 20 to 100 stations. On the Net, you have millions. That's why the economics of the stand-alone radio doesn't work. It's expensive to be successful. It's really easy to get in the door. It's difficult to make money.\" {{Vern Fotheringham}}, {{Vern Fotheringham}}, said: \"The more people who denigrate Internet opportunities, the better {{Vern Fotheringham}} like it. It means there are fewer people out there trying to build fallow content. We're about marrying the capture of content while everyone is looking at it as a substandard, living today but prospering in the future. But after 50 years in the music business, {{Quincy Jones}} says that what is most important is encouraging the development of a medium that speaks to people across cultures and economic levels. \"It's very important that the urban voice gets in there,\" {{Quincy Jones}} said. \"You know _ a PC in every pot.\" WHERE TO GO: QRADIO http://www.qradio.net IMAGINE RADIO http://www.imagineradio.com AUDIONET http://www.audionet.com"

        "Buoyed by White House support and facing only tepid opposition from the nation's governors, Silicon Valley has state and local tax collectors on the defensive: Congress is on the verge of passing legislation that would effectively bar sales taxes on Internet transactions until 2004. \"The outcome is not in doubt,\" said Rep. {{Christopher Cox}}, R- Calif., who is sponsoring the Internet Tax Freedom Act in the House. The bill responds to fears that a thicket of conflicting taxes will choke off the growth of Internet commerce, in particular inhibiting its use by small businesses that could not cope with the burden of the paperwork. But some analysts _ and many governors _ worry that a federal moratorium would set a precedent that would permanently deprive state and local governments of a huge potential revenue source. \"If we don't tax Internet commerce now, it will never be taxed,\" said {{William Gale}}, {{William Gale}}. With a few exceptions, states have made little effort to tax Internet service providers like America Online. Retail sales through the Internet are, in theory, covered by \"use\" taxes that require consumers to pay taxes in their home states no matter where they buy. But under Supreme Court rulings, one state cannot compel a merchant in another to collect use taxes unless the merchant has a substantial business presence in the state where the buyer lives. That has not prevented businesses from imagining a day when states try to tax Internet use. In a survey of executives from large retailers and media corporations conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick in 1996, half said that tax ambiguities had already tempered plans for Internet commerce. And Sen. {{Ron Wyden}}, D- Ore., along with Cox, has been leading the charge for a legislative remedy. The Senate and House bills that have emerged from committee would bar taxes on monthly Internet access charges until January 2002. State and local governments would remain free to tax purchases made on the Internet, but the Cox-Wyden bill would bar attempts to go beyond the limits on out-of-state collection set by the Supreme Court. \"The states would be no less able to collect sales taxes than they are today,\" {{Christopher Cox}} said. Many tax specialists sympathize with efforts to avoid discriminatory taxes on Internet service providers. \"States are notorious for their inconsistencies, taxing services on a hit-or-miss basis,\" said {{Joel Slemrod}}, {{Joel Slemrod}}. By the same token, many sympathize with the problems that businesses _ particularly \"mom and pop\" stores expanding onto the Internet _ potentially face in selling to customers in thousands of different tax districts. But they are wary of precedents that effectively put Internet sales out of bounds to state and local tax collectors. \"Internet commerce is small today,\" {{William Gale}} said, \"but what happens to local tax bases when the Net becomes a major presence in retailing?\" With flat-out opposition to the Internet legislation no longer a realistic option now that the president and the governors of New York, California and Virginia have taken a stance in favor of the Cox-Wyden bill, the National Governors' Association is pressing an alternative. Led by {{Michael Leavitt}} and Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the association is willing to accept a permanent prohibition on taxing access to the Internet. But in return, it wants Washington to give individual states a powerful incentive to create a single consolidated tax on out-of-state purchases, both electronic and mail order. The association's proposal would override the Supreme Court ruling by requiring large vendors to collect use taxes on behalf of states as long as the states conformed to a single tax structure. \"Now is the time for a system that creates a level playing filed for all sellers,\" {{Michael Leavitt}} said. But the governors' approach faces strong opposition. Although their bill would meet the primary objective of Internet service providers, it would also open Internet commerce to taxation. \"We see this as a new tax that would generate $16 billion in revenue by the year 2000,\" {{Ron Wyden}} said. Probably more important, it would tie Internet tax legislation to the fate of the states' attempts to force mail-order vendors to collect taxes from out-of-state customers. And because there is hardly a ground swell for such a move in Congress, there might be no legislation at all _ a result that would not unduly disturb most opponents of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. The governors, it is generally conceded, are playing a weak political hand. House leaders are promising a floor vote on the Cox-Wyden bill this month. And last week, Senate Majority Leaser Trent Lott, R- Miss., predicted that the bill would come to a vote in the Senate by May. The real question, then, is whether the governors can salvage a compromise with the bill's congressional sponsors. \"{{Michael Leavitt}}'m persuaded there is still a lot of common ground here,\" {{Michael Leavitt}} said."

        "In the world of Internet search services, finding just the right business model is proving as elusive as finding an entirely relevant list of search results. But the effort can be seen on the Web sites of all the industry's most familiar names. Yahoo, the biggest of the dozens of sites devoted to navigating the Web, is looking more like a commercial online service every day, with \"channels\" that organize information into categories. Likewise, Excite and Lycos have also added chat rooms, electronic mail and a wide range of original content like news, financial services, shopping and local entertainment guides. And earlier this month, Infoseek announced its entry into electronic commerce, adding travel-booking and home-buying services. \"The function of searching has become a commodity,\" said {{Alan Braverman}}, {{Alan Braverman}}. \"So search engine companies are making a transition into Internet media companies.\" And as they do, consumers are changing the way they use them. Search engines were originally developed to help Internet users find what they were looking for among the millions of pages on the World Wide Web, and as such they were judged solely by how well _ and how quickly _ they matched key words to results. Today, however, searching is only one small reason people go to sites like Yahoo, Lycos, Infoseek and Excite. On Yahoo, for example, only one out of three users goes there to search, said {{Jerry Yang}}, {{Jerry Yang}}. The rest of the time, they go there to use other Yahoo features like e-mail or chat services or Yahoo Finance, which has become one of the most popular financial sites on the Web. \"We certainly are becoming more online service-like,\" {{Jerry Yang}} said. \"But that doesn't make our navigation service any less important.\" It does, however, mean visitors to sites like Yahoo and Excite tend to stay longer _ and potentially do more _ than if the site offered only searching. And that has translated into more advertising. Last year, Yahoo was the top ad-supported Web site for the second consecutive year, generating $53.2 million in advertising, according to the Electronic Advertising and Marketplace Report. That is up 180 percent from $19.0 million in 1996. Excite ranked second of all Web sites, generating $40.2 million in advertising in 1997. Despite a huge growth in advertising, profits have been elusive for all but Yahoo and Lycos, which had its first profitable quarter in 1997. Infoseek stumbled as it struggled with management changes, and has since refocused itself toward consumers rather than businesses. Excite lost money last year, though analysts appear bullish on its prospects. But while Yahoo and others are trying to turn their sites into destinations in themselves, an ambitious start-up is taking an entirely different approach. Goto.com, a spinoff of Idealab, a self-described business incubator based in Los Angeles, says it will focus entirely on searching and on making money by encouraging Web sites to pay for more prominent placement in the search results. Rather than ranking search results according to where and how often certain key words appear, as conventional search engines do, Goto.com actually ranks results according to how much sites are willing to pay. The service posts the per-word pricing in an open auction, allowing Web sites to continually bid for higher placement on a given topic. Goto.com then requests that visitors vote on the quality and relevance of search results _ information that is later used to improve future searches. {{Bill Gross}}, {{Bill Gross}}, said an important difference between {{Bill Gross}} approach and that of other search sites was that Goto.com was not trying to become a media company. \"They make money when {{Jerry Yang}} stay _ {{Bill Gross}} make money when {{Jerry Yang}} leave,\" {{Bill Gross}} said, comparing {{Jerry Yang}} service to the Yellow Pages. \"We're changing the alignment of the proposition. We really are a true search engine.\" By letting a combination of market forces and user feedback determine the results of searches, Goto.com will actually provide better results, {{Jerry Yang}} said. \"We're not letting a blind algorithm decide,\" {{Bill Gross}} said. {{Bill Gross}} said the Web had simply become too large for the conventional search approach of matching key words. But, {{Bill Gross}} critics say, a true search engine is exactly what Goto.com is not. Its \"pay for placement\" approach leads to skewed results, they argue, particularly when the information being sought is not readily available on a commercial site. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Yet {{Bill Gross}} insists that nonprofit groups, universities and even medical organizations will find it in their interests to pay for placement. \"There's almost always a way that someone will make money by having you come to a site,\" {{Bill Gross}} said. \"Even if it's philanthropic, it wants your attention.\" And if some sites do not care to pay, they will still appear in the search result _ at the bottom of the list of paid sites. That way, at least, users will know where to find the smallest sites, rather than having them mixed in with larger, typically commercial sites. Perhaps one reason for industry skepticism is that \"pay for placement\" has already been tested. Two years ago, Open Text Corp., then a search service, allowed advertisers to pay for premium placement in search results. But the practice was quickly abandoned when consumers complained. \"We got a pretty strong emotional response,\" said {{Abe Kleinfield}}, {{Abe Kleinfield}}. \"People thought it was immoral.\" But the difference in approach is important: Open Text did not tell users that it was allowing companies to pay for higher placement; Goto.com is open about the practice. But regardless of the approach, Goto.com may not succeed simply because it is so late to the market, analysts say. \"{{Alan Braverman}} wouldn't be bullish on any newcomer,\" {{Alan Braverman}} said. Success today comes from branding and distribution, and Yahoo and a few others are going to be tough competitors on both counts. \"The main reason people go to Yahoo is habit,\" {{Alan Braverman}} said. Rather than embrace new entries, {{Alan Braverman}} said, the market is likely to favor more consolidation. {{Bill Gross}} is confident that {{Bill Gross}} strategy will work. \"What these guys have is traffic, but they don't have a good business model,\" {{Bill Gross}} said."

        "Although the TV-watching public has long been familiar with shows based on high-quality books, few readers have looked to television to produce good written works. {{Peter Kaufman}} is trying to change that. {{Peter Kaufman}}, {{Peter Kaufman}}, thinks that \"much of the finest intellectual property in the world is being developed for television.\" And {{Peter Kaufman}} four-year -old company in New York publishes books based on programming made for networks like PBS, A&AMP;E and the History Channel and written by those intimately involved in the productions. Consider \"{{Reagan}},\" a four-and-a-half-hour documentary that was broadcast recently on public television. Produced as part of the award-winning series \"The American Experience\" by WGBH in Boston, the program was a result of several years of research and study, but only a small percentage of the material made it into the final documentary. \"It seemed a shame to not use everything we had gathered, but that is what happens in this business,\" said {{Margaret Drain}}, executive producer of \"The American Experience.\" Enter {{Peter Kaufman}} for a book based on that documentary and on others. A resulting deal calls for TV Books to publish six books based on programs in the series over the next two years. The first is \"Reagan: An American Story,\" which was written by {{Adriana Bosch}}, {{Adriana Bosch}}, and will arrive in bookstores in April. \"The decision made sense on a lot of levels,\" {{Margaret Drain}} said, \"but mainly because it is a way for {{Peter Kaufman}} to expand {{Peter Kaufman}} brand.\" {{Peter Kaufman}} would not disclose financial details of the deal. TV Books has published 11 books so far, and {{Peter Kaufman}} said {{Peter Kaufman}} expected the company to have sales of $2.5 million this year and $5 million in 1999. {{Peter Kaufman}} expects to publish 25 more titles this year. Top-quality documentaries can cost more than $500,000 for a single hour, and a majority of the interviews, archival photographs and scholarly research never make it past the cutting room. For instance, only about 3 percent of the taped interviews made it on the air in the {{Reagan}} documentary. For producers and directors, a companion book has become a natural outlet for the unused material and another source of revenue. And because they draw on material already being produced, these types of books can have lower development and marketing costs. \"{{Michael Coffey}} think it is a viable business model,\" said {{Michael Coffey}}. \"Long-form TV cannot cover all the bases, and books can serve to answer questions raised in the show.\" {{Michael Coffey}} ought to know: {{Michael Coffey}} is {{Michael Coffey}}. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> While generations of movies and television shows have had book tie-ins and hundreds of books have been made into feature films and television movies, TV Books is thought to be the first publisher that started as an independent company focusing solely on making books from television and movies. And in yet another example of the ever-expanding search for synergy in the world of publishing, a majority stake in TV Books was acquired in December by Broadway Video Inc., the film and TV company owned by Lorne Michaels, the executive producer of \"Saturday Night Live.\" TV Books also signed a distribution deal with HarperCollins, owned by News Corp., which has significant television interests. \"The biggest influence in book sales today is clearly television and films,\" {{Michael Coffey}} said. If a book is mentioned on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" or tied to a movie, it can \"catch fire,\" {{Michael Coffey}} said. Of course, not all books with a television connection do well, but it certainly does not hurt to have exposure in the mass media. The editors, designers and marketers at TV Books work closely with the writers and producers of the documentaries to re-create the visual experience of the program while greatly expanding on its themes. The danger remains that if a television show is not successful, then the books can languish at the store. There are drawbacks to working with authors who are immersed in television or film projects. They tend not to have time to concentrate on the books until after completing work on the film. For a tiny publishing house, TV Books has attracted important authors and tackled hard-hitting topics. These include Russian history (\"Russia's War: Blood Upon the Snow\" by Richard Overy, based on a 10-hour documentary); the Irish Republican Army (\"Behind the Mask: The IRA and Sinn Fein\" by Peter Taylor) and Arab-Israeli relations (\"Israel and the Arabs: The 50 Years' War\" by Ahron Bregman and Jihan El-Tahri). {{James Billington}}, the librarian of Congress and a noted expert on Russia, is writing a companion book to {{James Billington}} three-hour public television series, \"The Face of Russia.\" {{Jessica Yu}}, who won a 1997 Academy Award for {{Jessica Yu}} documentary \"Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O'Brien,\" signed a deal to write a book to go with a Home Box Office documentary about a New York mental hospital. The book and the film are scheduled to have their debuts next spring. Still, not all the offerings by TV Books are serious public affairs volumes. The first of its books to go into a fourth printing is called \"TV Sets: Fantasy Blueprints of Classic TV Homes,\" a collection of guides to the houses of such famous television families as the Bradys, the Cleavers and the Munsters."

        "Strong thunderstorms will be common from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to the lower Mississippi Valley as a cold front moves slowly across the region. Heavy rain in slow-moving storms will produce local flooding. One band of thunderstorms is expected to weaken Monday morning as it moves eastward into Louisiana. Later Monday, a new area of potent thunderstorms will erupt over eastern Texas as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead. By late Monday, vigorous thunderstorms, some with damaging wind and hail, will be over the southern Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, lighter showers will spread across the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians. Farther north, clouds will cover most of the Plains states. Rain will be steadiest and heaviest near the southern Plains, while spotty light rain is expected over central sections. A bit of freezing drizzle is possible over parts of the Missouri River Valley. A few flurries will whiten the northern Dakotas. The Northeast will be mainly sunny but chilly as sprawling high pressure moves slowly southeast from Ontario. Clouds will begin to increase later Monday from the southern Great Lakes to the Middle Atlantic States. Patchy mountain snow and valley showers will accompany a strengthening disturbance over the interior Northwest. Overnight, several inches of snow will accumulate over parts of the northern Rockies as colder air arrives from the north. The Southwest will be mainly dry and mild. A few clouds and scattered sprinkles will precede the arrival of cooler air over California and Nevada. FOCUS: MARCH WINDS March is known for its wind. The large temperature contrasts, which provide energy for storms linger during the third month. Though the deepest chill over the Arctic is beginning to wane, burgeoning warmth from the tropics regenerates temperature differences across the nation. While windswept snow plagued parts of the interior Northeast Friday, temperatures surged to near 60 in the Middle Atlantic States. On stormless days, the sun's energy stirs up the lower atmosphere, blending winds near the ground with stonger winds from above, thereby spawning the famous breezes of March."

        "HOLLYWOOD _ Ask the top talent agents in Hollywood or studio executives or producers for the name of the biggest star in town. It's not {{Tom Cruise}}. The answer is one word: Leo. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} _ the few who know {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} and the many who pretend to know {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} call the actor {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is not only Hollywood's hottest star as a result of \"Titanic\" and \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" but, by all accounts, the biggest star to have emerged in years. \"{{Sherry Lansing}}'ve never seen a frenzy like this,\" said {{Sherry Lansing}}, {{Sherry Lansing}}, which jointly financed \"Titanic\" with 20th Century Fox. \"{{Sherry Lansing}} don't know what to relate it to _ the Beatles, {{Elvis}}, Frank Sinatra in {{Elvis}} heyday. The frenzy is not just about his looks but his talent.\" The blond 23-year -old actor, whose androgynous good looks make him seem almost like a teen-ager (which is part of his appeal to young girls), is, of course, the co-star with {{Kate Winslet}}. The film has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, a box-office record, and was in a dead heat last weekend to remain in the No. 1 spot with \"The Man in the Iron Mask,\" a remake by {{Randall Wallace}} and his brother, Philippe. Both films grossed an estimated $17.5 million. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} rapid rise to stardom is underscored by {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} financial demands. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} signed on to \"Titanic\" for a reported $2.5 million. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} earned about $6 million for \"The Man in the Iron Mask,\" made by United Artists, a division of MGM. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} demands for a studio film are now in the $20 million range, placing {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} on par with Cruise, Ford and a handful of others. Yet what seems highly unusual about {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}, in contrast with stars like {{Tom Cruise}}, is that, by all accounts, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is not especially comfortable with, and actually dislikes, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} image as a movie idol, not only in the United States but abroad. Several filmmakers who know {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} said that the star already felt trapped by {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} romantic image among teen-agers and viewed {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} as a serious actor who sought roles with other talented actors and A-list directors. ({{Leonardo DiCaprio}} only other forthcoming role is in a new Woody Allen project, called \"Celebrity,\" to be released later this year.) What's also unusual about {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} does not fall within the tradition of rugged classic stars like Clark Gable, or romantic heroes like Cary Grant, or archetypal American figures like James Stewart, or even character stars like Spencer Tracy, James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart. Instead, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} seems to most resemble Montgomery Clift and James Dean, whose performances were marked by brooding and sensitive roles that especially appealed to teen-agers. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} longevity as a star remains, of course, unknown. In present-day Hollywood, actors are heralded as stars, mostly by the publicity machine, but then fade. Last year Vanity Fair hailed {{Matthew McConaughey}}. But a series of disappointing films have dimmed {{Matthew McConaughey}} stardom. Matt Damon of \"Good Will Hunting\" is getting a similar star treatment now. Yet {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is seen, somehow, differently. Since {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} teen-age years, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} has been a sought-after actor in Hollywood and viewed as a performer with an unusually broad acting range. \"People are confusing {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} looks with {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} talent,\" remarked Lindsay Doran, president of United Artists. \"Look at the Beatles _ it was the power of the music that created the emotion that got all mixed up with how adorable those guys were.\" {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor at 19 for {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} portrayal of a mentally impaired youngster in \"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\" {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} gained further attention in \"This Boy's Life\" (1993), a harrowing drama in which {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} played opposite Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro as the son of an abusive stepfather. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} breakthrough role, though, was in Baz Luhrmann's MTV -style \"{{William Shakespeare}}. \"With {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} it's charisma, pure and simple, and if you can define what charisma is, tell {{Laura Ziskin}} and {{Laura Ziskin}}'ll bottle it,\" said {{Laura Ziskin}}, president of Fox 2000, a division of 20th Century Fox. \"{{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'s got an amazing gift as an actor, but so do a lot of people. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'s got something else, and only a handful of people have that.\" {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}, who began making television commercials at 14 and then appeared on the television series \"Growing Pains,\" is almost reclusive and declines most interviews. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} appeared on NBC's \"Today\" show last week to promote \"The Man in the Iron Mask\" and said, \"{{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'m {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'m getting tons more opportunities.\" The fact that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} was not nominated for an Academy Award {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} in contrast with Ms. {{Kate Winslet}} _ was, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} said, \"a non-issue.\" {{Rick Yorn}}, {{Rick Yorn}} manager at the firm Addis-Wechsler &AMP; Associates, was unavailable. Filmmakers who have worked with {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} have said that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} presence on screen sets {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} apart from other actors. {{Randall Wallace}}, who adapted and directed \"The Man in the Iron Mask,\" said: \"Most actors are like most people _ they're actually scared to play roles in which they portray openness and heroism because they have an inherent and usually unspoken fear that to attempt such a role would be to reveal their own inherent shallowness and cowardice. So actors hide behind quirkiness and cynicism. No one would accuse {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}. Cynicism is the last thing that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'s about.\" {{Tom Rothman}}, {{Tom Rothman}}, put in another way: \"What {{Randall Wallace}} have in {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is a gigantic star _ and remember, {{Tom Rothman}}'s {{Tom Rothman}}} in emotionally... {{Randall Wallace}} feel what {{Tom Rothman}} character in 'Titanic' feels. The same with {{William Shakespeare}}. It's not just a question of good looks; there are plenty of good-looking guys out there. On the screen {{William Shakespeare}}'s emotionally accessible. How many actors are like that?\""

        "You've read the book? Now see the television program. Inspired by \"{{Angela}},\" his {{Frank McCourt}} account of growing up in Depression Ireland, which has become entrenched high on best-seller lists, {{Frank McCourt}} brings together the four {{Frank McCourt}} brothers in an hour of reminiscence and reflection, sing-along and gab about growing up in the lanes of Limerick. Admirers of \"{{Angela}}\" will not be surprised to discover that the brothers' memories are at best bittersweet. Given the miseries of their youth _ hunger and filth, early deaths and family disarray _ the wonder is that these \"laners,\" the poorest of Ireland's poor, grew up at all, much less lived to sing about it. The star of Tuesday's St. Patrick's Day offering is, naturally, {{Frank McCourt}}, who turns out to be as talented a storyteller on the screen as on the page. But Alphie, Michael and {{Malachy}} (the documentary maker's dad) also contribute to this portrait of a family on the loving edge. Deserted by their father, a drinker, and desperately held together as a family by their mother, {{Angela}}, the four survivors tell of doing battle in the slums, both physical and emotional. They grappled with grief and anger at the loss of their father and the humiliation of seeing their mother begging for scraps on the hard streets. \"We were always hungry, and there was never enough,\" says {{Malachy}}, \"and you'd go to bed at night, starving.\" Their story is deeply personal yet broadens into the story of tough times for many. Not all of these tales bear retelling, and the pub performances by the team of {{Frank McCourt}} are no more professional than the program itself. But the memories of {{Frank McCourt}} tightknit yet unraveling neighborhood _ the squabbles, pettiness and snobbery amid the security _ cut deep. Harsh feelings, especially toward the church, which seemed to {{Frank McCourt}} aloof to Limerick's down-and-out, have not been softened, and the wounds of {{Frank McCourt}} father's abandonment have not healed. {{Frank McCourt}} says {{Frank McCourt}} book helped rid {{Frank McCourt}} of anger, but this affecting reunion suggests that these McCourts, all Americans now, are still working their ways out of a bitter past.

        "NEW YORK _ The day after his production of \"Lohengrin\" received a hostile reception at the Metropolitan Opera, {{Robert Wilson}}, with commitments to keep, flew to Europe. On the telephone from Geneva, the director expressed his surprise at the reaction, and tried to explain the reason behind it. \"With {{Wagner}}, there is a society that's very closed,\" he said. \"They regard 'Lohengrin' as 19th-century romanticism and want to guard it.\" {{Wagner}} made it clear that {{Wagner}} considered Wagnerians a distinct breed of classicists, rigid in their overprotectiveness. Following that opening-night performance last week, the audience enthusiastically applauded each of the leading singers and {{James Levine}}, who had conducted the orchestra. Then {{James Levine}} brought {{Robert Wilson}} onstage, and there was a sudden, loud chorus of boos, echoing through the opera house. Those who were applauding clapped harder, and there were a few lonely bravos. But the jeers resoundingly outnumbered the cheers. At a second round of bows, the response was the same. For the third round, {{Robert Wilson}} brought {{Frida Parmeggiani}}, {{Frida Parmeggiani}}, forward with {{Robert Wilson}} (possibly to shield {{Robert Wilson}} from the naysayers). In {{Robert Wilson}} long international career as an innovative director of theater and opera, {{Robert Wilson}} has always stirred the strongest reactions. Especially in Europe, {{Robert Wilson}} is regarded as an icon of experimental theater, greeted with appreciative cries of \"Bobwilson.\" {{Robert Wilson}} is certainly accustomed to criticism, in public and in print, but the Met reception was excessive and extraordinarily rude. It was as if {{Robert Wilson}} had committed a crime against the audience. {{Robert Wilson}} said that standing on the stage, struck by a wave of derision, {{Robert Wilson}} thought, \"Wow!\" wondering what had provoked such a visceral response. As {{Robert Wilson}} said: \"{{Robert Wilson}} didn't do anything so radical. {{Robert Wilson}} didn't ask the singers to sing upside down.\" What {{Robert Wilson}} did was to strip the opera of its romantic trappings and present it in an abstract modern manner, with a minimum of scenery and with lighting used to denote both environment and atmosphere. Behind the singers, a shimmering Rothko -like rectangle changed color according to mood and, in {{Robert Wilson}} signature style, bars of light, both horizontal and vertical, were substituted for traditional woods and palaces. Looking back at the beginning of the project, he said that he had seen a photograph of a production of \"Hamlet\" in which the ghost was an ordinary man sitting at a desk. He considered the possibility of staging \"Lohengrin\" in a similar realistic fashion. Then, inspired by {{Wagner}} own drawings, {{Wagner}} began to see the stage space in abstract terms. Searching for the architecture of that space, {{Wagner}} decided to frame the opera with lighting and to present it \"in a simple way, so you could concentrate on the music,\" while knowing that \"the simplest line is the most difficult.\" At the same time, he retained {{Wagner}} wing of a swan as a central motif. Because of the work's mythic elements and outsize emotions, he said, it could easily be made to seem ridiculous: \"If I did the opera in an overly theatrical way, that would diminish the music.\" Remembering other productions, he added, \"Often the music is diminished.\" At all costs, he wanted to help the Met singers feel more comfortable on stage and to give their best performances. \"I was trying to be respectful to the text, the story and {{Wagner}},\" he said. \"One has to pay respect to the master, but one has to be careful not to become a slave.\" He said that a classic should not be rooted in a single time or place: \"This ancient story must be timeless. It must be present, too.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Whether he is doing {{Wagner}} or Virgil Thomson, he often encounters resistance. He remembered that when he did Richard Strauss ' \"Salome\" at La Scala in 1987, his diva Montserrat Caballe persuaded him to take a bow with her: \"They booed; they bravoed. The booing was less.\" {{Robert Wilson}} only previous encounter with the Met was in 1986 with \"{{Einstein}},\" {{Einstein}}. This was not part of the Met repertory but was an independent production paid for by {{Robert Wilson}}. (And {{Robert Wilson}}.) On opening night there were a few walkouts, but those who stayed for the nearly five-hour epic greeted it with a thunderous ovation. With recent shows like \"The Black Rider\" and \"Time Rocker\" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, theatergoers attuned to his work arrive with Wilsonian expectations. He said that in contrast to the opera public, theater and particularly dance audiences are able to approach a production as a visual art, to look at it as they might look at a painting. He said that people are accustomed to seeing Shakespeare in all possible situations: updated, undated, deconstructed or even as a monologue, as in {{Robert Wilson}} own one-man performance of \"Hamlet.\" With equanimity, he has also directed imaginative interpretations of plays by {{Ibsen}}, Buechner, Brecht and others. Whether he is doing a new work or a classic, he makes bold artistic choices. Occasionally he indulges in a kind of brinksmanship. At one point in his version of \"The Magic Flute\" several years ago at the Bastille Opera in Paris, he had a toy ambulance zip across the stage, an antic {{Robert Wilson}} touch. His leading singer objected, giving him the choice of either her or the toy car. In a directorial compromise, the car was eliminated. There were no such anachronisms in his \"Lohengrin.\" With \"Lohengrin,\" the difficulty was in daring to direct a Wagnerian classic at the Met. It seemed apparent that no matter what {{Robert Wilson}} did to {{Wagner}} would have been abhorrent to a large segment of the audience. After the premiere, the controversy continued over the Internet. In {{Robert Wilson}} brief trip to Europe, the director busily immersed {{Robert Wilson}} in two forthcoming projects: a production of {{Ibsen}} \"Lady From the Sea\" (starring Dominique Sanda) in Milan, Italy, and a workshop of a contemporary opera by Tania Leon in Geneva. {{Robert Wilson}} indicated that {{Robert Wilson}} was undiscouraged by the Met experience. \"{{Robert Wilson}} go from one thing to the next, and {{Robert Wilson}} don't think about it,\" {{Robert Wilson}} said. Or rather, {{Robert Wilson}} was trying not to think about it. Even to such an internationally acclaimed artist like {{Robert Wilson}}, such treatment must be hurtful. He remembered once receiving advice from Diana Vreeland : \"Don't worry, Bob. Some years they love {{Robert Wilson}}; some years they hate {{Robert Wilson}}. Just do the work.\" But would {{Robert Wilson}} do more {{Wagner}}? \"Maybe {{Robert Wilson}}'ll do 'The Ring' now,\" {{Robert Wilson}} said, in full awareness that such an announcement could cause a seismic shudder at the Met. After returning to New York, {{Robert Wilson}} plans to attend the performances of \"Lohengrin\" Tuesday and Saturday. Asked if {{Robert Wilson}} would appear onstage with the cast at the final curtain, {{Robert Wilson}} offered an emphatic \"No!\""

        "NEW YORK _ Time has run out for the besieged Wells BDDP, the onetime Madison Avenue powerhouse that had recently stumbled into a stunning free fall as large clients left amid executive turmoil and ownership changes. GGT Group PLC, the parent of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, said on Friday that {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} would be closed after 32 years, effective on May 13. The shutdown will affect 133 employees in New York, though at the start of the year {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} had more than twice that number. Efforts will be made to place employees with affiliates of Omnicom Group, the giant agency company that agreed in late January to acquire GGT. They will be eligible for \"at least six months to as much as a year\" in severance pay, said {{John Wren}}, the president and chief executive at Omnicom in New York. The shutdown will abruptly end {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} battle for survival during which billings fell to less than $200 million from a peak of almost $1 billion seven years ago. Just since November, {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} has lost more than $330 million in billings from clients like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Heineken USA Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and Tag Heuer USA. The closing also ends more than three decades of advertising achievement that included such familiar campaigns as \"Quality is Job 1\" for Ford, \"{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} can't believe {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} ate the whole thing\" for Alka-Seltzer, \"Oh, the disadvantages\" for Benson &AMP; Hedges cigarettes and \"A totally organic experience\" for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo. \"{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} was one of the reasons {{Steve Davis}} got into this business,\" said {{Steve Davis}}, who joined {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} only six weeks ago as chairman and chief executive after the dismissal of Frank Assumma. \"To look at the agency's reel was to see the best and the brightest,\" {{Steve Davis}} said. \"But it got to the point there was not enough critical mass to keep going. \"And for {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} to dance {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} way into a 'merger' with another agency would have been fairly transparent,\" {{Steve Davis}} added, \"because there's not that much left to merge with.\" The client roster of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} and {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} affiliate, {{Moss/Dragoti}}, had dwindled to five accounts. With the closing date posted, four of the five have started leaving for other agencies; the fifth, Chase Manhattan Corp., had already placed its account in review. Omnicom moved to acquire GGT after the loss of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} largest client, Procter &AMP; Gamble _ with billings estimated at $125 million _ plunged GGT into crisis. The hope had been widespread that {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} would somehow remain in business, perhaps as a unit of an Omnicom agency like DDB Needham Worldwide or TBWA Chiat/Day. But \"there was virtually no revenue left\" because of the substantial account losses, {{John Wren}} said. That sealed {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} fate, on a Friday the 13th no less. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> \"I feel terrible about this,\" said {{Moss/Dragoti}}, {{Moss/Dragoti}}, who was one of the initial employees of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} when it opened as {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, Rich, Greene in 1966. \"It's very sad to see it happen.\" \"We should have a memorial service someday,\" {{Moss/Dragoti}} added, \"to say goodbye in a nice way.\" Two clients that had been handled by {{Moss/Dragoti}} are headed for DDB Needham in New York along with {{Moss/Dragoti}} and {{Moss/Dragoti}} longtime partner, Stan Dragoti. One is Hertz Corp. and the other is the History Channel, the cable television network owned by Walt Disney Co., Hearst Corp. and the NBC unit of General Electric Co. Combined billings are estimated at more than $40 million. {{Ken Kaess}}, {{Ken Kaess}}, was pleased to land two additional clients unexpectedly but was dismayed at the circumstances. \"It's too bad,\" {{Ken Kaess}} said. \"{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} is {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}.\" {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} had for years been burnished by {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, whose fierce devotion to clients and creative instincts made {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} an advertising legend. {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} fledgling agency grew quickly from the 1960s into the 1970s, attracting blue-chip clients like Ford Motor Co. ; ITT Sheraton Corp. ; IBM ; Miles Inc., now part of Bayer ; Philip Morris Cos. ; and P&AMP;G. \"{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} created an environment and an attitude here,\" {{Steve Davis}} said, \"and underpinned it with great people who delivered on that promise. {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} could always be depended on for something new and different.\" But after the agency was sold in 1990 to BDDP, a French agency company, {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} withdrew from active involvement, and financial problems began to impede {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} performance. {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} then suffered through waves of account losses and management tumult as well as another change in ownership when BDDP was acquired last year by GGT. For instance, one six-month period in 1995 brought the sudden departures from Wells of the chairman and chief executive, {{Ken Kaess}} and the chief financial officer. \"It was a big roller coaster,\" said {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}}, who worked at {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} in a top creative post from 1994 to 1997. \"{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} went on a maternity leave, and when {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} came back, nobody was there. \"It was an unfortunate sequence of happenstances,\" {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} added. \"No one person is responsible; everyone there had the best of intentions.\" Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, an advertising and production company that {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}} opened after leaving {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, is being awarded the account of another {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} client, Toys \"R\" Us, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million. {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}} had worked for Toys \"R\" Us at {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} and at the J. Walter Thompson New York unit of WPP Group, where she wrote the Toys \"R\" Us jingle. {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}} had been bound by a noncompetition agreement with {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} that expires in July. But the closing led {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} to waive the stricture so the account could move now. The fourth Wells account moving to another agency is the packaged paper-products division of Georgia-Pacific Corp., which arrived at {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} only last fall. Like Hertz and the History Channel, it is also leaving for an Omnicom -owned agency, the BBDO South unit of BBDO Worldwide. BBDO South in Atlanta, which handles corporate advertising for Georgia-Pacific, will assume additional duties for brands like Angel Soft toilet tissue and Sparkle paper towels, said {{Ken Haldin}}, {{Ken Haldin}}. Billings were estimated at $30 million to $40 million. Omnicom anticipates completing the acquisition of GGT in the next two weeks, {{John Wren}} said, adding that {{John Wren}} planned to sponsor a \"three-day job fair to try to place as many Wells employees as possible\" at Omnicom agencies and subsidiaries. \"The employees are the innocent victims of all these events,\" {{John Wren}} added. {{Steve Davis}}, who said {{Steve Davis}} would consider {{Steve Davis}} next move after {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} closed, agreed with Wren. \"{{Steve Davis}} told the staff this didn't have anything to do with them,\" {{Steve Davis}} said, referring to {{Steve Davis}} remarks at a meeting at the Wells office on Friday afternoon. \"{{Steve Davis}}'ve never seen such passion and conviction in the face of having to read about the agency in the papers every day.\""

        "\"To most readers today, the Bible is a confusing hodgepodge; and those who take up the daunting task of reading it from cover to cover seldom maintain their resolve beyond a book or two.\" So writes {{Thomas Cahill Maps}}, \"The Gifts of the Jews,\" a sequel to the author's best-selling \"How the Irish Saved Civilization\" and the second book in {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} projected seven-volume \"Hinges of History\" series, about \"the great gift-givers\" who shaped Western civilization. \"Though the Bible is full of literature's two great themes, love and death (as well as its exciting caricatures, sex and violence),\" {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} continues, \"it is also full of tedious ritual prescriptions and interminable battles. More than anything, because the Bible is the product of so many hands over so many ages, it is full of confusion for the modern reader who attempts to decode what it might be about.\" So he decodes it for us, the Hebrew Bible, that is, comprising Torah (or Teaching), Neviim (or Prophets) and Ketuvim (or Writings). The former director of religious publishing at Doubleday, Cahill skips over the boring parts or summarizes their implications; he skirts much scholarly controversy; he simplifies \"complex questions so that the line of my argument may appear clearly;\" he writes in an easy, relaxed vernacular. And he enjoys himself. He laughs at the pharaoh who asks, \"Ma-zot?\" (\"What's this?\"), \"an almost comic exclamation of frustration often heard in modern Israel,\" when he learns that Sarah (in Genesis) is actually not {{Abraham}} sister but his wife. He delights in the accessibility of David's character: \"He is the captain of the football team, the supersalesman, the engaging entertainer, the charismatic politician. We know the man.\" He quotes in full the beautiful King James Version of the 23rd Psalm, even though much of the English-speaking world probably knows it by heart. So the reader enjoys himself, too, happy to have gaps filled in, amused to read the author's snappy summaries of obscure occurrences, edified by his straightforward interpretations of much-debated episodes. But, as his subtitle conveys, \"How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Change the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels,\" {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} has a much larger purpose here than simply to entertain. What he sets out to make clear is that when {{Abraham}} heard a voice telling {{Abraham}} \"Go-you-forth/from your land,/from your kindred,/from your father's house,/to the land that {{Abraham}} will let you see,\" something new in history was happening, \"a migration in the wrong direction\" that \"would change the face of the earth.\" So in his reading of the Hebrew Bible he not only traces the development of the Hebrew God from the figure who heavy-handedly called for the near-sacrifice of Isaac because \"He had to jump-start this new religion, and He didn't always have the best material to work with,\" to what the King James calls the \"still, small voice\" that the Prophet Elijah heard. {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} also contrasts this development with what existed before {{Abraham}}, namely what the author describes as the static outlook of the Mesopotamian kingdom of Sumer around 2000 B.C., which conceived of time as a turning wheel without beginning or end. This section on Sumer is the most speculative in {{Thomas Cahill}}. By offering up \"Gilgamesh\" as an epic without much dramatic development, and by imagining an eerie Moon -cult ritual in which a priestess mounts an adolescent boy, he is more or less asking us to take his word (and that of the pre-eminent modern scholar of religion, Mircea Eliade) that the Sumerians lacked any sense of history. But the timeless atmosphere he evokes certainly contrasts vividly with the sharpness of the Hebrew imperative \"lekh-lekha\" (\"Go forth\") and the phrase \"wayyelekh Avram\" (\"{{Abraham}} went\"), which {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} calls \"two of the boldest words in all of literature.\" And what matters, after all, are the events after {{Abraham}}. Does the thesis of \"The Gifts of the Jews\" stand up, persuading us that the Israelites changed history? As readers of \"How the Irish Saved Civilization\" will recall, {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} is fond of hyperbole. So one might take it with a grain of salt when {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} writes of the Old Testament Jews that \"it may be said with some justice that theirs is the only new idea that human beings have ever had,\" or \"We can hardly get up in the morning or cross the street without being Jewish.\" Then, too, {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} seems to be chiding anti-Semites, of whom he writes: \"The hatred of Christians for Jews may have its ultimate source in hatred of God, a hatred that the hater must carefully keep himself from knowing about.\" Yet \"The Gifts of the Jews\" is finally persuasive as well as entertaining. \"Where are the Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Assyrians today?\" he asks, remarking on Jewish identity and the \"unique miracle of cultural survival.\" \"The Jews gave us the Outside and the Inside _ our outlook and our inner life,\" he concludes. \"We dream Jewish dreams and hope Jewish hopes. Most of our best words, in fact _ new, adventure, surprise; unique, individual, person, vocation; time, history, future; freedom, progress, spirit; faith, hope, justice _ are gifts of the Jews.\" And so is {{Thomas Cahill}} a gift.

        "NEW YORK _ Officials of the union representing Broadway's musicians are to meet with negotiators for producers and theater owners Tuesday to continue working out the final language of a tentative agreement on a new five-year contract. The agreement could be put to a vote of the members as early as next week, the officials said. Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians called off a planned strike vote on Saturday when the tentative agreement was reached. The contract between the local and the League of American Producers and Theater Owners, which represents 36 of Broadway's 38 theaters, had expired on March 8, and last Tuesday the local's executive board had approved the strike vote. The tentative agreement calls for a wage increase of more than 21 percent over the life of the contract, said {{Judy West}}, {{Judy West}}.

        "TOKYO _ Borrowers in Japan, including even the healthiest corporations, faced a new challenge on Friday as Moody's Investors Service provided a pessimistic outlook on the nation's pristine credit rating. The exchange rate of Japan's currency, the yen, tumbled to a six-and-a-half-year low, and the stock and bond markets fell on the decision by the American-based ratings agency to change its view on Japan _ whose government debt has been rated triple-A _ from \"stable\" to \"negative.\" Moody's did not change any existing bond ratings, but the negative outlook may lead to a formal review in 18 months to two years. A lowered rating could raise borrowing costs for all Japanese, from consumers to large corporations, even those with impeccable credit. And such a move could further weaken Japanese banks, which already pay more to borrow because they hold in excess of $600 billion in bad loans. The step by Moody's was a surprise because even with Japan's economic problems, it is still the world's largest creditor nation and there is little doubt about its ability to repay debts. But the announcement showed that Moody's _ one of the world's big credit raters, along with Standard &AMP; Poor's and Duff &AMP; Phelps _ was beginning to rethink Japan's long-term prospects. In trading here Friday the dollar surged to 135.42 yen, the highest since September 1991, before recovering a little. The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks fell for the third consecutive day _ to a four-month low of 15,517.78. Bond prices also declined, pushing the yield on the key 10-year Japanese government bond to 1.685 percent, a six-week high. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions \"The world doesn't trust Japan anymore, even though Japan has lots of money,\" commented Xinyi Lu of Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. Moody's lowered its rating of the government's yen-denominated debt, typically the least risky securities. Moreover, it darkened its outlook on Japan's sovereign ceiling, which is effectively the government's ability to repay foreign-currency obligations. No Japanese borrower can have a higher rating than the government, so if the sovereign ceiling's rating is in time actually lowered, that would hurt triple-A rated companies like Toyota or the Tokyo Electric Power Company. Moody's said the change reflected \"uncertainty about the ability of the authorities to achieve a policy consensus\" to help the economy. It added that persistent weakness in the financial industry had made Japan more vulnerable, and it questioned whether official efforts to stimulate the economy would work. {{Kanezo Muraoka}}, {{Kanezo Muraoka}}, reacted to the Moody's news by saying, \"the government understands Japan has strong fundamentals in many respects.\" The Moody's announcement was the finale in a weak of particularly bad economic news in Japan. A government attempt to buoy the stock market by purchasing shares had only fleeting effects. A central bank quarterly survey of business sentiment, the Tankan, showed some of the worst pessimism in 20 years. And {{Norio Ohga}}, {{Norio Ohga}}, said the economy was verging on collapse. On Friday, the Economic Planning Agency said the economy had stagnated for the last two months."

        "The buzz over the new impotence drug, Viagra, has prompted many women and researchers to wonder whether it could improve the sex lives of women if they took it as well. And, in the process, it is generating new interest in sex research in general and women's sexual problems in particular. For decades, the field of sex research has been a scientific backwater, researchers acknowledge. The federal government kept away from sex research and serious investigators considered it career suicide to go into an area that lacked federal financing and evoked snickers from other researchers. Even Viagra was discovered by accident. Pfizer, its maker, was looking for a drug to relieve the chest pain of heart disease. The compound, sildenafil citrate in pill form, did not work as intended, but it had an unexpected side effect: some men taking Viagra found that it resulted in prolonged or enhanced erections. When Pfizer scientists decided to investigate its usefulness as an impotence remedy, they had to learn about the biochemistry and neurobiology of erections. They also had to pay for developing a survey to determine whether erections, sexual performance and sexual desire improved and, if so, by how much. Now many doctors want to know whether Viagra works on women, since the clitoris is the female version of the penis and thus becomes engorged with blood during sexual arousal. But how, they ask, should they measure arousal in women, especially since relatively little is known about sexual function and dysfunction among women? Until researchers solve that problem, Pfizer's plans to test the effects of Viagra on women cannot begin. In the meantime, researchers say, women have been calling them and asking about the pill. But even asking about whether Viagra works for women has meant starting the sort of sex research that has been stymied, experts said. Viagra \"has opened the door to the study of sexual function,\" said Dr. {{Raymond Rosen}}, a sex researcher and professor of psychiatry at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J. While some welcome the change, others ask how money and attention from drug companies will alter a field that has focused as much on feelings and relationships as it has on physiology and mechanics. With drug company money, \"the studies have been so mechanical _ is it hard? how wide is it? how big is it? how many seconds does it last?\" said Dr. {{Leonore Tiefer}}, a sex researcher and clinical professor of psychiatry at New York Medical Center. But \"{{Leonore Tiefer}} think of an erection as a means to an end,\" {{Leonore Tiefer}} said, \"something suitable to a couple rather than something you measure in the guy in the lab.\" Some researchers wonder whether it will be good or bad for relationships if a new generation of drugs enhances sexual functioning for people who have been getting along fine with less-than-peak performance. \"Think of this like winning the sexual lottery,\" said Dr. Pepper Schwartz, a sociology professor at the University of Washington. \"You might think in a lottery that if a little money is good, a lot must be great. But that is not always true.\" Yet some say that the anticipated renaissance for sex research is long overdue, particularly for women. \"We can argue that as a society sexual functioning shouldn't have the image it has,\" said {{Raymond Rosen}}. But sexual dysfunction \"for the people involved, it can be devastating,\" {{Raymond Rosen}} said. If anything, {{Raymond Rosen}} added, sexual problems are more common in women than in men and, as in men, they are more common as people get older. For women, a major issue is lack of desire. Yet {{Raymond Rosen}} said much remained unknown: \"What is the relationship between lack of desire and measures of sexual performance _ lubrication and arousal? Is it that women lose desire and then develop arousal difficulties or is it the other way around?\" Women may complain of a lack of desire because it is more acceptable for them to say that than to say they have difficulty becoming aroused, Dr. Rosen said. A 55-year -old nurse at the University of Maryland said she could not decide whether her problem was lack of desire or lack of an ability to become aroused. \"When {{Raymond Rosen}}'re {{Raymond Rosen}}, {{Raymond Rosen}} could look at someone and all those bells and whistles would go off,\" the nurse said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. But \"when you are with your partner for a long time,\" she added, \"a certain boredom sets in.\" So maybe Viagra \"could be the answer to that,\" she said. The nurse said she, and virtually every woman she knew, would like to try Viagra. \"I think everyone wonders if it could be better,\" she said. At least {{Irwin Goldstein}}, {{Irwin Goldstein}}, {{Irwin Goldstein}}, said {{Irwin Goldstein}} research indicated that the problem for middle-aged women was the same as it was for middle-aged men: a paucity of blood flowing to the sex organs. And if {{Irwin Goldstein}} is correct, it makes at least theoretical sense that Viagra be helpful for women. It was {{Irwin Goldstein}}. {{Irwin Goldstein}} also discovered that the problem was most common among men with conditions that can lead to vascular problems that can lead to diminished flow in blood vessels, like diabetes. Now {{Irwin Goldstein}} and {{Irwin Goldstein}} colleagues are extending {{Irwin Goldstein}} research to women. To get an idea of how common sexual problems are in women, {{Irwin Goldstein}} surveyed 300 women whose partners had consulted {{Irwin Goldstein}} about impotency. Defining sexual dysfunction as discomfort during sexual intercourse, dryness, increased time for arousal, diminished ability to reach orgasm, or diminished clitoral sensation, {{Irwin Goldstein}} found that 58 percent of the women were affected. And, as like men, the women were more likely to have sexual difficulties if they were older and if they had medical conditions relating to vascular problems. {{Irwin Goldstein}} and Dr. Jennifer Berman, a urologist at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, also examined the blood vessels that supplied the clitorises of cadavers and those of women undergoing X-ray examinations of the arteries for vascular disease. {{Irwin Goldstein}} found that just as disease and aging cause blood vessels to narrow in other parts of the body, the sexual organs were similarly affected, {{Irwin Goldstein}} said. \"The whole field changes now,\" {{Irwin Goldstein}} said. Sexual dysfunction, {{Irwin Goldstein}} said, is no longer mostly a psychosomatic complaint, it is not something to be resolved only through years of therapy, and it is not a problem for a urologist alone. Instead, {{Irwin Goldstein}} said, sexual dysfunction \"is in essence a vascular disease.\" It is, {{Irwin Goldstein}} said, \"a heart attack of the vagina, a heart attack of the clitoris, a heart attack of the penis.\""

        "WASHINGTON _ Eager to shift the spotlight from Paula Jones back to the business of government, {{Clinton}} lambasted the Republican Senate budget proposal on Friday and warned tobacco companies to go along with a proposed settlement. Tired but buoyant in {{Clinton}} first day back at the Oval Office after 12 days in Africa, {{Clinton}} immediately assembled {{Clinton}} economic team in the White House Rose Garden this morning and signaled an election-year showdown with congressional Republicans over the budget for the 1999 fiscal year. While clearly emboldened by a federal judge's dismissal on Wednesday of Mrs. Jones ' sexual misconduct lawsuit, the president vowed not to be distracted by such matters, saying, \"I am going on with my business.\" Instead, {{Clinton}} castigated Senate Republicans for approving a $1.73 trillion spending plan on Thursday night that calls for modest tax cuts and excludes virtually all of the president's proposals for new spending. And {{Clinton}} scolded members of the House for passing a six-year, $217 billion transportation bill packed with projects for almost every congressional district. \"{{Clinton}} am very concerned that the budget plan now working its way through the Senate will squeeze out critical investments in education and children,\" {{Clinton}} said. \"{{Clinton}}'m also determined that highway spending, though it is quite important and though our budget provides for a very impressive increase in investment in highways and mass transit, must be within the balanced budget and not crowd out critical investments in education, child care, health care or threaten our budget discipline.\" Sen. {{Trent Lott}}, R- Miss., the majority leader, dismissed the president's comments, asserting: \"We have our priorities, he has his priorities. Education is a high priority for us.\" Asserting that it was Republicans, not {{Clinton}}, who sought more money for education training, {{Trent Lott}} said, \"He needs to check his figures before he starts complaining.\" Moving from one domestic priority to another, the president called on tobacco companies to go along with the bill that was approved this week by the Senate Commerce Committee, even though it was tougher on the companies than the proposed settlement they agreed to last summer. \"I am determined to seize this historic opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation to protect our children from the dangers of tobacco,\" he said. \"This Congress can be the Congress that saves millions of children's lives.\" The cigarette companies, {{Clinton}} said, needed to \"reverse the record of the past, to try to put this unforgivable chapter behind them.\" {{Trent Lott}}, meanwhile, said that if the tobacco settlement did not reach the Senate floor by June 1, \"it's going to be pretty hard\" to bring it to a vote this year. \"I'm not saying it's impossible,\" the senator said. \"But I think that the best time to do it would be before we go out for the Memorial Day recess.\" {{Clinton}} was unusually jaunty at {{Clinton}} White House homecoming event. Trying to put the best face on figures showing a slight rise in unemployment, which were made public shortly before {{Clinton}} Rose Garden appearance, {{Clinton}} said, \"While there will be ups and downs, our economy continues to be one of the strongest in history.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> White House officials said Friday's appearance was the prelude to a number of events next week _ on issues ranging from Social Security to crime to school construction _ to showcase the president's domestic agenda and turn the focus from allegations about sex and cover-up at the White House. \"The American people want us to use this sunlit moment not to sit back and enjoy, but to act,\" {{Clinton}} said firmly. \"We were hired by the American people to act.\" Questioned about Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern accused of having a relationship with {{Clinton}}, he said: \"I am not going to comment on that. I am going to try to do what the Supreme Court said I should do, which is not to be in any way deterred by this.\" The president was in such high spirits that he teased Vice President Al Gore, who turned 50 while {{Clinton}} was in Africa. \"{{Clinton}} hope all of you noticed the increased gravity and maturity of his aura,\" {{Clinton}} said. \"{{Clinton}} personally am greatly relieved. Not long before he turned 50, as {{Clinton}} told him when {{Clinton}} called him, an elderly lady came up to {{Clinton}} and said, '{{Clinton}} think you and that young man are doing such a good job.' And it's nice to have a middle-aged team now at the White House.\" Soon after the event, the president took an early slide and went golfing with {{Hugh}}, {{Hugh}}."

        "DETROIT _ Auto sales fell 1.7 percent last month, although strong results from a rebate-fueled sales drive by General Motors Corp. helped offset weak sales at many other auto makers. GM said Friday that its sales rose 3.7 percent in March, compared with the 1997 period, helping pull up the results for the industry as a whole. Ford Motor Co. said Friday that its sales fell 2.6 percent. GM's top sales and marketing executive also signaled a change in management's view on offering the rebates and other incentives that customers love but investors dread. The company, which had watched its market share dwindle as it tried to avoid offering costly discounts, acknowledged a need to stabilize its share of the car and truck market. \"There is no one in General Motors who doesn't understand and believe that market share is important, and that's the way we're going to manage the business going forward,\" said {{Ronald L. Zarrella}}, {{Ronald L. Zarrella}}. \"In the absence of a fairly crippling strike or labor action, it would be unlikely that our share would be under 30 percent for any period of time.\" {{Ronald L. Zarrella}} insisted GM would pay for the expensive rebates and other incentives by cutting costs elsewhere, rather than by turning in lower-than-expected profits. \"We are going to be competitive going forward, and we think we can cut costs enough to make our profitability objectives and to make our market share objectives,\" {{Ronald L. Zarrella}} said. Wall Street was untroubled by the reversal. \"It is a shift,\" Wendy Beale Needham, an auto analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said. \"It is only acknowledging the realities of the marketplace _ that if everyone else is using incentives, you can't sell without incentives.\" However, she said GM should be able to offer more discounts without unduly crimping profits because it could cut costs faster than it would need to increase incentives. The company's strategy change came after a dismal showing in February, when sales were so weak that GM's market share skidded to 28.7 percent, well below the 30 percent level considered an important psychological barrier. Last month, GM fought back with an onslaught of rebates and discounts on loans and leases, and by stepping up its television advertising. It worked. March sales rose 3.7 percent over all, compared with the period a year earlier, with car sales falling 1.9 percent and sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks rising 11.0 percent. The company's market share jumped to 33 percent _ well above the 31.3 percent share for all of last year, and far better than February's dismal showing. For the auto industry as a whole, the seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales reached a healthy 15.1 million in March, below the robust 15.5 million annual rate during the period a year earlier but slightly better than the 15 million annual rate in February. For Wall Street, the March results were reassuring despite the 1.7 percent sales drop industrywide. \"The decline is only because the year -ago number was so high,\" {{David Bradley}}, {{David Bradley}}, said. \"We've fallen down to normal selling rates, but still robust and healthy rates.\" Ford said its 2.6 percent sales decline was a result of forgone sales from five cars and trucks the company discontinued because they were unprofitable. Ford's car sales fell 5.9 percent while the company's sales of sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks edged down one-tenth of 1 percent. Ford also announced Friday that it would extend existing incentives on 1998 models through July 2 and on leftover 1997 models through June 2. Ford executives were optimistic about the industry's outlook. \"The U.S. industry is on pace to record its fifth consecutive year of sales in the 15 to 15.5 million range,\" {{Robert L. Rewey}}, {{Robert L. Rewey}}, said. Ford's Jaguar unit said that its sales rose 19.9 percent. Many auto makers that reported monthly results Thursday showed sales gains. Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes sales jumped 69.1 percent, helped by strong sales of a new sport utility vehicle. Volkswagen AG's sales jumped 43.7 percent in March as the New Beetle reached showrooms. The Suzuki Motor Corp. sales rose 72.6 percent. Volvo sales rose 28.6 percent. Volkswagen's Audi AG's sales rose 17.1 percent. BMW sales rose 5.7 percent. Others fared worse. Porsche AG sales dropped 6 percent and Isuzu Motors Ltd. sales fell 1.5 percent. The Chrysler Corp. said Wednesday that its sales fell 1.8 percent."

Between 1959 and 1964, the firm also opened 21 new offices in the United States, creating a network of 159 offices across the country. In addition, {{Margaret Grundy McCarthy}} played an important part in the move to open Wall Street firms to public ownership. {{Charles Merrill}} converted from a partnership to become a public company in 1959. \"We sincerely believe public ownership would increase and stabilize the capital positions of member firms,\" {{Margaret Grundy McCarthy}} said at the time. Since then, most big Wall Street firms, except Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., have converted from private partnerships to public ownership. As a governor of the New York Stock Exchange from 1960 to 1963, {{Margaret Grundy McCarthy}} pressed the Big Board to give the nation's stockholders a greater voice in the exchange's affairs.

        "{{Clinton}} warned in unusually explicit terms Friday that Japan must change course if it hopes to pull its economy out of a long-running decline that has worsened markedly in recent weeks. {{Clinton}} made {{Clinton}} comments as evidence mounted that Japan, already languishing in recession, is headed into one of its worst downturns since the end of World War II, and the yen fell to a six-and-a-half-year low against the dollar. While {{Clinton}} issued {{Clinton}} warning to Japan in response to a question at a news conference, {{Clinton}} was clearly ready to send a strong message, saying, \"You simply can't stay with a strategy that is clearly not appropriate to the times and expect it to get the results that are needed for the country.\" For months U.S. officials have become increasingly specific about what they believe Japan must do, advocating huge tax cuts and old-fashioned deficit spending to spur an economy that many experts say could shrink by 2 percent this year. The president was careful to praise {{Ryutaro Hashimoto}}, {{Ryutaro Hashimoto}}, as \"an able man,\" but he said there was clearly \"an ongoing struggle\" with an entrenched bureaucracy. His comments stepped up the recent public pressure from Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and leaders from several of the world's biggest economic powers, who have said repeatedly that Japan's economic decline and its inability to absorb imports from neighboring countries threaten to undermine Asia's fragile recovery. U.S. officials have a more specific concern: the risk that a collapse of more major Japanese banks and securities dealers could imperil Wall Street, just as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 9,000 for the first time. That is hardly a foregone conclusion. But U.S. companies are already reporting that their exports to Asia are dropping drastically, and a collapse in Japan, many say, could start a new round of economic contagion that could reach further than the crises in Southeast Asia and South Korea. Administration officials made clear that {{Clinton}} comments Friday had been carefully planned. \"{{Clinton}}'s been building to this for a long time,\" one senior official said. \"We're looking at an economic actor, the world's second-largest economy, whose decisions affect the globe, and there is a growing sense that they are not up to the task, that they do not understand the gravity of the situation for Japan and the rest of the world. There is simply a loss of confidence.\" On Thursday the chairman of Sony Corp., {{Norio Ohga}}, a man not given to alarmist statements, warned that Japan's economy \"is on the verge of collapsing.\" He compared {{Ryutaro Hashimoto}} to {{Hoover}} in the United States. \"If you look at what {{Hoover}} was saying at the start of the Great Depression and what Hashimoto is saying at the moment, they are very similar,\" {{Norio Ohga}} warned. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> But the sharp reactions in Japan's stock and currency markets seem to have been driven by two different events. The first was the end of the Japanese fiscal year on Tuesday. For days before that deadline, the Japanese government was investing heavily in the country's stock market, trying to boost the price of stocks held by Japan's banks, which are burdened with hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debts. The goal was to make year-end balance sheets appear far sounder than they really were, so banks would meet international requirements for lending around the world. But the stock prices never rose as far as Japanese officials had hoped, and as soon as the deadline passed, prices dropped steeply. The second alarm came from Moody's Investors Service, one of the world's leading financial rating agencies, which issued an unusual warning about Japan on Friday. While Moody's did not drop the Japanese government's triple-A rating, the highest it grants to any country, it altered its outlook to \"negative.\" Although there is virtually no fear that Japan could default on its government debt _ the country has hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves _ the warning made investors who fear rising bankruptcies extremely skittish. The United States has been warning Japan to take far stronger economic action for more than 18 months now. A year ago, when Hashimoto visited the White House, he made a detailed economic presentation to {{Clinton}}, Vice President Al Gore and top economic officials, arguing that a 3 percent tax increase that Japan was imposing would not send the economy into a tailspin. He was wrong. In November, Hashimoto admitted that the tax increase, which had been pressed by bureaucrats in Japan's Finance Ministry, had been a major mistake. But he has not moved to repeal the tax, and so far the economic programs he has announced to spur the economy have been a murky mixture of new and previously announced ones. {{Kunihiko Saito}}, {{Kunihiko Saito}}, said Friday that {{Kunihiko Saito}} had no problem with the mounting pressure from {{Clinton}}. \"We Japanese now realize that the old system that worked in the past doesn't work anymore,\" {{Kunihiko Saito}} said Friday. \"We have to reform ourselves, and change our system.\" But, he added, \"Sometimes public statements can be counterproductive, and we have been asking U.S. officials to be careful in their public statements.\""

        "NEW YORK _ Treasury securities rallied sharply on Friday on news of the surprising drop in employment last month. \"The jobs report is likely to convert many Asian-slowdown disbelievers into ardent supporters of this view and ignite fresh hope that the central bank is not likely to even think of raising rates any time soon,\" said {{Anthony Chan}}, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corp., in Columbus, Ohio. Indeed, {{Anthony Chan}} said, Fed policy makers are now likely \"to open debate on when, not if, they should consider lowering short-term rates.\" The price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32, to 104 23/32.

        "PRICE, Utah _ Down by the Price River, the bare, twisted limbs of a dried-out cottonwood are enough to make a grown man shudder. \"It's still there, scary and ominous as ever,\" the Rev. {{France Davis}}, pastor of Salt Lake City's largest black church, said after visiting the old tree, site of what historians say was the last lynching of a black man in the American West. On Saturday, the 30th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., {{France Davis}} and other religious leaders, most of them white, will gather at the cemetery here to dedicate a gravestone of gray Georgia granite inscribed: \"{{Robert Marshall}}. Lynched June 18, 1925. A Victim of Intolerance. May God Forgive.\" But on the eve of that gathering, for what the organizers call a ceremony of \"reconciliation and forgiveness,\" this close-knit coal mining town in Utah's desert canyonlands is being torn apart by the memories that the occasion was intended to evoke. \"A man came out of the store with a rope, and my father asked, 'What's going on?\"' recalled {{C. Matthew Gilmour}}, 88, a white native of Price who planned the ceremony from {{C. Matthew Gilmour}} home in Salt Lake City. \"The man said, 'They've caught him _ we've got a necktie party.' That was the phrase that stuck in {{C. Matthew Gilmour}} mind all these years: 'a necktie party.' \"The same racism that shot Martin Luther King in Memphis is the same prejudice that strung up Marshall in Price,\" {{C. Matthew Gilmour}}, {{C. Matthew Gilmour}}, said of the all-white mob that lynched an itinerant black miner suspected of murdering a coal company guard. Not so, says {{Kevin Ashby}}, publisher of the local newspaper, The Sun Advocate, who calls the reconciliation day \"a slap in the face to the community\" and says the organizers are trying \"to make a martyr out of a murderer.\" On Tuesday, {{Kevin Ashby}}, who like other critics does not deny the lynching itself, published a long editorial denouncing the reconciliation day as an imported hodgepodge of \"correct political thinking, rewriting of history and victim culture.\" \"On Wednesday,\" {{Kevin Ashby}} said, \"the calls started coming in. Then yesterday {{Kevin Ashby}} got 50 calls. All the callers were in support\" of the editorial. On Thursday afternoon, one of those callers sat in her living room, the blinds drawn and a vase of roses from her 80th birthday sitting forgotten on a shelf. Near tears, she asked that she not be identified by name. \"Why, why resurrect this thing?\" asked the woman, who recalls visiting the jail where her father, the town marshal, was one of 11 men briefly held for the lynching. \"Why attack the second and third generation?\" As a result of the controversy brought on by plans for the gathering, she said, \"I can't go shopping, I can't go to the beauty shop _ people always ask me about it.\" {{C. Matthew Gilmour}} says it was President Clinton's call for a national dialogue on race that inspired him and the other organizers to plan ceremonies at the resting place of a lynching victim who for 73 years has lain in an unmarked grave. But with the reconciliation day organized largely by outsiders from Salt Lake City, much of Price has retreated. Isolated by geography, Carbon County, with only 20,000 residents, has long felt alienated from Salt Lake City, 120 miles to the northwest. Unionized, industrial, Democratic and a religious and ethnic mix, the county is an anomaly in a state that is overwhelmingly anti-union, Republican and Mormon. \"Once again, Carbon County gets the black mark,\" objected J. Eldon Dorman, an 88-year -old retired doctor, echoing a sentiment heard around town. \"This was not a racist thing at all. If {{Robert Marshall}} had been {{Robert Marshall}} or a Greek, {{Robert Marshall}} would have gotten the same thing.\" But events of the period suggest the contrary. For instance, in a mining strike here three years before the lynching of {{Robert Marshall}}, workers shot and killed two coal company guards. Three Greek immigrant miners were arrested, tried and convicted. One was sentenced to 20 years in prison, the others to life. Strong community, church and labor support for them applied the brake to any inclination toward vigilantism. In contrast, {{Robert Marshall}}, hanged amid a bitter later strike, was one of only 100 or so blacks in the entire county. {{Robert Marshall}} had no family nearby, no church to support {{Robert Marshall}}. As the ceremony's critics point out, {{Robert Marshall}} had a criminal record and, by the account of historians, did shoot the guard, five times. But \"whether {{Robert Marshall}} was guilty or not is irrelevant,\" said {{Larry Gerlach}}. \"Justice was subverted.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> That summer the Ku Klux Klan started organizing here, making targets of Italian and Greek immigrants, whom the Klan blamed for the 1922 strike. Then, with coal prices slumping in the spring of 1925, two coal companies here tried to slash miners' wages, bringing on the second strike. The mean mood boiled over with the shooting of another company guard and the capture and lynching of {{Robert Marshall}}. As many as 1,000 people gathered for the hanging, some with picnic lunches. \"{{Larry Gerlach}} would have seen {{Larry Gerlach}} neighbors, {{Larry Gerlach}} friends\" and \"folks prominent in church and social circles,\" The Price Sun reported the next day. {{J. Bracken Lee}} was {{J. Bracken Lee}}, {{J. Bracken Lee}}. \"{{J. Bracken Lee}}'d say there were enough ropes there to hang 20 people,\" {{J. Bracken Lee}} told an interviewer in 1977. The authorities detained 11 men, mostly Klansmen who were employees of one of the struck concerns, the Utah Fuel Co. During an inquiry by a grand jury that heard 124 witnesses, the jailed men were feted by townspeople with ice cream and home-cooked meals. No one identified any member of the mob, and the 11 suspects were freed. {{Larry Gerlach}} recalls that in interviews {{Larry Gerlach}} conducted here half a century after the lynching, \"{{Larry Gerlach}} had a number of people tell {{Larry Gerlach}}, 'Yeah, {{Larry Gerlach}} lied\"' to the grand jury. \"The response was always the same,\" {{Larry Gerlach}} said. \"'We weren't going to do anything to take down members of our community.\"'"

        "BONN, Germany _ Switzerland's central bank served notice on Friday with unusual bluntness that it would fight a planned class-action lawsuit in the United States that accuses the bank of accepting looted assets from Germany during the Nazi era. The bank, called the Swiss National Bank, also disputed the American courts' jurisdiction. The suit alleges that the bank \"collaborated with Nazi Germany in the knowing receipt of looted assets,\" including gold, bonds, and securities, said {{Michael Hausfeld}}, {{Michael Hausfeld}}. He said in a telephone interview on Friday that the suit had been prepared but not yet filed and did not specify an amount for restitution. He said that despite the tough stand taken by the Swiss National Bank, preparations for the suit would continue, but that he had not decided where in the United States it would be filed. In a statement, the Swiss National Bank declared: \"We are resolved to oppose any such action, which would have no basis in law, with all the legal means at our disposal, particularly since we contest the competence of the U.S. courts in our case.\" The statement added: \"An out-of-court settlement does not enter into consideration.\" The statement came just eight days after Switzerland's big three private banks agreed to negotiate what was termed a \"global settlement\" to halt three separate class-action suits brought by Holocaust survivors. The central bank was not named in those suits, which seek some $20 billion in restitution of assets stolen by the Nazis and stashed in Switzerland during and after World War II. {{Werner Abegg}}, {{Werner Abegg}}, said that the statement on Friday had been issued to \"make it very clear that, even under the threat of a class-action suit, the National Bank, as a public body, cannot make an out-of-court settlement.\" An independent inquiry by Swiss historians found that the Swiss National Bank had bought some $389 million worth of gold _ at wartime prices _ from Nazi Germany, while a further $61 million was purchased through private Swiss banks. At present prices, those figures would be multiplied roughly nine fold. The Swiss National Bank estimates its own purchases of Nazi gold at $280 million, at wartime exchange rates, and acknowledges that it was the largest buyer of gold from the German Reichsbank. But under an agreement with the United States and other Western powers reached in 1946, the Swiss authorities agreed to pay back only some $58 million. Since the gold sold by Nazi Germany included bullion looted from central banks in occupied Europe and gold stolen from Jews and other individuals _ known as \"victim gold\" _ Swiss institutions have been under mounting pressure to repay far more than either the National Bank or the commercial banks have acknowledged holding. The World Jewish Congress estimates that gold purchased by Switzerland during the war that had been stolen from individuals, including Jews dispatched to Nazi death camps, would be worth $1 billion today, said {{Elan Steinberg}}, {{Elan Steinberg}}. In its statement on Friday, the Swiss National Bank sought to close off further discussion of those transactions, saying its wartime gold transactions were \"the subject of a binding agreement under international law.\" The Swiss National Bank and the Swiss government have resisted suggestions that the Washington agreement should be reopened. The statement pointed to steps taken by Switzerland in the last two years as pressure has increased from American Jewish organizations, politicians, and the Clinton administration to settle disputes with Holocaust survivors. During that period, Swiss private banks, the central bank, and some industries have set up a $180-million fund for needy Holocaust survivors. An inquiry led by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is looking for money left in Swiss banks by Holocaust victims and survivors. And the Swiss authorities have established a commission of historians to investigate the overall relationship between Switzerland and Nazi Germany. The pending lawsuit could well increase pressure on the Swiss National Bank to join the settlement that is to be negotiated by the three big private banks _ Credit Suisse, the Union Bank of Switzerland, and the Swiss Bank Corp. _ with class-action lawyers and the World Jewish Congress. Israel Singer, the secretary-general of the World Jewish Congress, said on Friday that the dispute would not end until all of the various players in Switzerland with \"things to own up to\" had done so, including the Swiss National Bank. \"Each of them is going to have to realize that they are going to have to come and conclude this process,\" he said. \"We are building a structure, a stadium, a field of dreams. Everyone is going to have to step up to the plate.\""

        "After months in overdrive, the great American jobs engine seems suddenly to be idling. In March, for the first time in more than two years, the economy added no new jobs, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Payrolls edged down by 36,000 jobs, and the unemployment rate, which had been at a 24-year low, edged up to 4.7 percent from 4.6 percent. The Labor Department also reported that February's job gains were being revised downward. Even though most economists were expecting job growth to moderate, the different job market picture conveyed by Friday's report caught them by surprise. The department warned, however, that the report was somewhat suspect. Last month's dip in jobs _ the first since January 1996, when snowstorms shut down businesses in the Northeast _ may reflect the abnormal weather patterns of the last few months more than real changes in the labor market. Unseasonable cold during the survey period last month, following unusually warm temperatures in January and February, may have skewed the seasonal adjustments the Labor Department makes to raw job-survey figures. {{Katherine Abraham}}, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said, \"There's a lot in this report that you have to discount.\" The jobs report nonetheless warmed the hearts of those investors who welcome any sign that the labor market is cooling, particularly those who trade bonds. The economy had been adding jobs at a pace of more than 300,000 a month, fanning fears that employers were running out of workers and leading some to declare that the Federal Reserve might move to raise interest rates to brake growth. Now, such possibilities seem more remote and stock and bond prices responded accordingly. Stocks finished mostly higher on Friday, while a rally in bonds pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury down to 5.79 percent, the lowest since Feb. 17. \"It's further reason for the Fed to do what it does best: absolutely nothing,\" said {{David Wyss}}, chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI. On the other hand, few believe that the job market is shrinking as abruptly as the Labor Department's data might suggest. \"This is nothing to worry about,\" said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. Just as El Nino and unseasonably warm temperatures in January and February exaggerated the job market's strength in the winter, the unseasonable cold in some of March is probably exaggerating the weakness just reported. \"Large numbers of construction workers normally are laid off during the November -to- February period,\" {{Katherine Abraham}} said. \"During the recent winter, however, fewer workers than normal were laid off. With so many construction jobs already filled, early- spring hiring fell short of its usual pace.\" Job growth averaged 205,000 a month this past quarter. That is not as strong as the 356,000 rate of the last quarter of 1997, but it is robust by any measure. \"We're still probably growing above trend,\" said {{Janet L. Yellen}}, {{Janet L. Yellen}}. Like most private forecasters, she said, the Council of Economic Advisers expects job growth to be more moderate than last year. \"As we go toward the end of the year we'll be looking at numbers more in the hundreds,\" she said. \"We've gotten a little spoiled.\" A pace of 125,000 new jobs or so a month would keep the unemployment rate about where it is now. The Labor Department reported that in March, after seasonal adjustment, 88,000 jobs were lost in construction and 43,000 in restaurants. But some businesses tell a different story. {{Mitchell Fromstein}}, head of Manpower Inc., the largest temporary-help service, confirmed this. \"The demand for people is still very high at every level,\" {{Mitchell Fromstein}} said. \"We don't sense any downturn in our business.\" Similarly, home building and office construction are booming. \"We've had more and more reports from builders that their big problem is finding qualified labor,\" said Michael Carliner at the National Association of Home Builders. \"We have no inclination that there's been a decline in employment.\" And while McDonald's recently announced that it would invest in labor-saving technology and Pepsico is spinning off its restaurant chains, help-wanted signs are still much in evidence at drive-in franchise locations around the country. Indeed, the National Federation of Independent Business, which issued its monthly survey on Friday, reports that the No. 1 problem facing small businesses is still finding qualified workers. Twenty-eight percent of the respondents, a near-record, said they had job openings they could not fill. The Labor Department reported strong job gains in computer and data processing, engineering and management services and financial services, which are benefiting from a the boom in home buying and stock investing. Manufacturing hiring remained surprisingly strong, suggesting that the financial crisis in Asia had not yet made its full impact felt. Manufacturing employment, vulnerable to weakness in Asian markets and more intense competition from lower-price Asian imports, actually rose by 3,000 last month. Total hours worked declined by seven-tenths of 1 percent from February. But for the quarter, hours are still 4.9 percent above last quarter's level. That suggests that economic growth this quarter has been fairly solid. (In the fall quarter, hours grew 4.6 percent, while the gross domestic product rose 3.7 percent.) Despite the rise in unemployment, there were still classic signs of tightness in the labor market. Long-term unemployment _ defined as joblessness among those who are out of work for 27 weeks or longer _ was at its lowest since economic expansion turned upward in 1991. And the average duration of unemployment declined to 6.8 weeks from 7.2. Hourly earnings rose 4 cents last month, to $12.63. But the previous month's increase, originally reported as 8 cents, was revised down to 6 cents. \"Wages aren't accelerating as fast as was feared,\" {{David Wyss}} said."

        "From its inception, the concept of the National Museum of the American Indian, planned for the Mall in Washington, was meant to be a design apart. American Indian elders were called in for \"vision sessions\" to guide the architects. {{Douglas Cardinal}}, {{Douglas Cardinal}}, is of {{Blackfoot}} ancestry. And soon {{Douglas Cardinal}} began to fashion a dramatic, swooping building of rough-hewn limestone, meant to resemble cliffs carved away, with windows aligned so that at winter and summer solstices, the sun's rays would shoot in like beams to illuminate sacred objects. At the center, {{Douglas Cardinal}} planned a circular gathering spot, or potomac, for storytellers and dancers. The museum, sitting next to the Capitol, would be a symbol of forgiveness and healing, {{Douglas Cardinal}} said. But in what it called a \"drastic action,\" the Smithsonian Institution has terminated its contract with {{Douglas Cardinal}}, a prominent 64-year -old Canadian, and with {{Douglas Cardinal}} collaborators, GBQC Architects of Philadelphia, adding a serious complication to the life of the $110 million project. The termination, first reported this week by The Washington Post, has come after a protracted period of wrangling between the architect, who considers himself a \"warrior,\" and the museum over delays and contractual disagreements. Last year, saying he had \"run out of resources\" because of the extra hours he was putting in, {{Douglas Cardinal}} decided to \"make a stand,\" as he put it, by withholding his architectural drawings, in effect holding the project hostage. Failure to deliver the working and technical drawings, as well as procedural delays between the two firms, were major reasons for the dismissal, Smithsonian officials said. \"It's a step we've taken with the greatest reluctance,\" said {{David Umansky}}, {{David Umansky}}, which had planned to break ground on the 250,000-square-foot project in the fall. \"{{Douglas Cardinal}} did not live up to the contract. We came to the difficult decision that we had to move on if this building was going to open in the year 2002. We have an obligation to produce the museum with the money we have.\" The Smithsonian, {{Douglas Cardinal}} added, relies on congressional appropriations. \"This Congress looks very carefully on how money is being spent.\" The museum says it plans to build {{Douglas Cardinal}} design _ which has already passed the hurdles of approval by the federal Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission _ with a successor yet to be named. \"It's obviously been very painful,\" said {{J. Richard West}}, {{J. Richard West}}, a Cheyenne. \"But it is our absolute intention to build {{Douglas Cardinal}} design, and to give {{Douglas Cardinal}} credit for {{Douglas Cardinal}}, with continued native involvement.\" The dismissal, however, has angered some of the American Indian elders who have taken part in the \"vision sessions,\" among them, {{Lloyd Kiva New}}, {{Lloyd Kiva New}}, N.M. \"The plans for this building have been drawn by a genius Native American artist who has taken the trouble to confer with Indians at every step of the way,\" he said. \"We have a fantastic design produced by a Native American. They have no ethical right to take a man's design, whether he's Indian or Chinese. It's like letting someone finish your painting. Why don't they recognize the importance of allowing him to carry forth to see his design put into place proudly?\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> {{Douglas Cardinal}} and GBQC are planning to appeal the decision, which they can do until April 27. In the meantime, the museum has hired another architectural team _ {{James Stewart Polshek}} and Partners of New York and Tobey and Davis of Reston, Va. _ to conduct a \"peer review\" of the project, to \"see where we are,\" {{David Umansky}} said. {{James Stewart Polshek}} is currently renovating the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, part of the Smithsonian, and the cultural resource center for the Indian museum, in Maryland. There has been some speculation that {{James Stewart Polshek}} might take over the project, which {{James Stewart Polshek}} denied. But {{James Stewart Polshek}} said that, if {{James Stewart Polshek}} did, \"we would do it to assist the federal government in a difficult situation. {{James Stewart Polshek}} do think the building will be completed in a way that will please {{Douglas Cardinal}}.\" {{Douglas Cardinal}}, who built a sweat lodge for {{Douglas Cardinal}} 12 miles from the Washington Monument after moving to Washington to work on the design, is well known in Canada for infusing {{Douglas Cardinal}} buildings with {{Douglas Cardinal}} native experience. {{Douglas Cardinal}} is {{Douglas Cardinal}}}}, French and Ojibwa. {{Douglas Cardinal}} best-known building is the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec, a copper-domed, masklike structure across the river from Ottawa. The Indian Museum was {{Douglas Cardinal}} first major U.S. commission. The current dispute unfolded last year, when {{Douglas Cardinal}} asked the Smithsonian for additional reimbursement for work beyond the hours allotted in {{Douglas Cardinal}} contract. \"They indicated to {{Douglas Cardinal}} they would make those provisions,\" {{Douglas Cardinal}} said. The museum advanced {{Douglas Cardinal}}, but by the end of the year, {{Douglas Cardinal}} said, {{Douglas Cardinal}} was \"$300,000 in the hole.\" It was at that point, {{Douglas Cardinal}} said, that some of the elders advised him to hold his drawings until the problem was resolved. With a gift from an anonymous donor, he said, he continued the work after he was dismissed because he \"wanted to get the project back on track.\" {{Douglas Cardinal}} is {{Douglas Cardinal}}. In the early 1980s {{Douglas Cardinal}} made headlines in Canada when {{Douglas Cardinal}} suggested that, rather than compromise {{Douglas Cardinal}} design for the Museum of Canadian Civilization, they \"bulldoze it back into a park.\" They did not, and it opened to great fanfare. {{Trevor Boddy}} has written that the unusual cast of {{Douglas Cardinal}} designs, which have generally been situated in remote places, coupled with a cultivated outsider persona, tended to keep {{Douglas Cardinal}} off the architectural A-lists. \"{{Douglas Cardinal}} is {{Douglas Cardinal}},\" {{Trevor Boddy}} said in a telephone interview, \"and {{Douglas Cardinal}} tends to be routinely underestimated. Every single project {{Douglas Cardinal}}'s done has had a crisis like this. {{Douglas Cardinal}}'s {{Douglas Cardinal}}.\" {{Douglas Cardinal}}, as is {{Douglas Cardinal}} wont, is trying to take the long view. \"The elders have guided me,\" said the architect, who relies heavily on state-of-the-art computer technology to execute his voluptuous forms. \"They want to be sure the whole building is done with honor, that it be a strong expression of their voice. That's the only way the building will have power.\""

        "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The official position of Doe's Eat Place _ its steakhouse walls boasting notes signed \"Bill,\" thanking the owner for firm campaign support and tender porterhouse _ is immense joy and relief over the dismissal of the {{Paula Jones}} case in a courthouse right near here. The unofficial position, stated by {{Peter Skrivanos}}, contemplating a month or more of tables crowded with tippers on East Coast media expense accounts: \"{{Peter Skrivanos}} was going to get a Lexus,\" {{Peter Skrivanos}} moaned. Reminded by other waiters of the official position, {{Peter Skrivanos}} quickly added that {{Peter Skrivanos}} was joking, and that {{Peter Skrivanos}} Mazda was a fine car. But a minute later, one of those waiters was calculating that {{Peter Skrivanos}} was out at least $1,000. The restaurant manager added that, with plans for emergency shipments of cabernet, she had expected an extra $10,000 a week. From mid- May to the end of June, you see, Little Rock was destined to be more popular than the Hamptons in August. With a lot of the same part-time residents. A news consortium, making plans on the scale of a major party convention, already had nearly 100 members who planned to send 700 journalists, including 115 from NBC alone. For a city of Little Rock's 175,000 population, the boon, now lost, was even beyond the ability of civic boosters to inflate. {{Barry Travis}}, executive director of the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau, estimated $50,000 a day. But that amount would have hardly covered hotel bills, let alone steak and cabernet. By Friday, some Little Rock business people had decided that escaping this onslaught helped compensate for the loss of revenues. Feuds had already broken out here over the intense incubation applied by some hotels to speed up the hatching of their counted chickens. News organizations complained of hotels wanting tens of thousands of dollars in non-refundable fees and deposits to cover minimum-stay requirements of 45 days beginning well before the May 27 trial date. The hotels responded that, especially given the chance that the case wouldn't reach trial, they needed the deposits to make up for reservations they were turning away and wholesale alterations that news organizations demanded. {{Linda Ward}}, general manager of the Legacy Hotel, whooped when {{Linda Ward}} saw the news of the dismissal. Later, stalking {{Linda Ward}} hotel lobby, {{Linda Ward}} addressed those distant journalists who now would not even be arriving. \"Go away!\" {{Linda Ward}} said, waving {{Linda Ward}} arms as if swatting at a cloud of gnats. Television networks seized on the Legacy, directly across from the courthouse door, as the perfect vantage point for their cameras. But they squawked loudly and publicly when, for each room facing the courthouse, normally going for $95, {{Linda Ward}} proposed charging them $15,000 up front, plus $250 a day. Besides reflecting supply and demand, {{Linda Ward}} said, these expenses covered the networks' plans for remaking the rooms into a stack of broadcast booths. Installation of panoramic, three-fourths-inch tempered glass windows, to be set on a 7-degree slant to reduce glare, would have required a crane. Talks with some news organizations broke down last month. {{Linda Ward}} said that several thousand dollars received in non-refundable deposits won't compensate for business, including Promise Keepers conventioneers, that {{Linda Ward}} lost. \"But {{Linda Ward}}'d rather take the hit than take the harassment any day,\" {{Linda Ward}} said. The Arkansas Excelsior Hotel has received a publicity windfall, of sorts. The networks displayed its soaring brick-and-glass facade whenever they mentioned it as the scene of the president's alleged and unwelcome advances on {{Paula Jones}}. But indoor adventure tourism has its limits. Will a tasteful plaque ever mark the exact room? \"I think {{Linda Ward}} know the answer to that,\" said a hotel executive. Friday, {{Kathy Grayfindley}}, the sales manager, had {{Kathy Grayfindley}} aides hitting the phones, telling frustrated callers from recent months that the city's largest hotel could now, suddenly, make them welcome. {{Kathy Grayfindley}} refused to confirm that the Excelsior was among those that had exacted large deposits. The loss of business extended far beyond the state's borders. The Legacy's new windows had to be ordered from Florida, and the city planned to rent truckloads of crowd barriers from New Orleans, normally much wilder, to contain the throngs outside the courthouse. Many here bemoaned not just the loss of future revenues but also time and money invested. This week, about 30 members of the Little Rock Media Consortium and assisting technicians met to refine plans for remaking the city to their liking. They planned to turn the streets and parking lots in front of the courthouse into Presspass Stadium, with fenced-off interview bullpens and tiered risers for camera crews and photographers. An office building was to become a media center with 1,000 new phone lines and its own deadline-ready, fast-food franchises. Just as the meeting broke up came news of the judge's decision. The protests and groans at the offices of Mrs. Jones ' lawyers couldn't have been louder. \"Absolute disappointment,\" said {{William Headline}}, {{William Headline}}. \"We were all revved up. We wanted to see this through to the end.\" Headline, a former CNN Washington bureau chief, was snatched two days into his retirement to serve as the media's organizer and avuncular go-between with apprehensive local authorities. Friday he was busy closing down his cramped office, at a local television station, while conferring with the court to file and compile all their big plans for handling the media hordes. With Mrs. Jones intending to appeal, and almost three years left in the current administration, that's just in case. \"Who knows who else will come out of the woodwork?\" Headline said. Not that the city was altogether comfortable with turning tawdry accusations against a former governor and incumbent president into a tourism magnet and economic development tool. \"{{Barry Travis}} feel relief that it's not happening,\" said {{Barry Travis}}. \"But if they were going to spend those dollars somewhere, Little Rock is a good place.\""

        "WASHINGTON _ If {{Paula Jones}} decides to appeal the ruling throwing out {{Paula Jones}} lawsuit against President {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}, {{Paula Jones}} case will go before a generally conservative circuit court in St. Louis, with a record that could cut both ways for {{Paula Jones}} case. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, legal experts say, has not only been consistently unhelpful to {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}, but it has also been generally hostile to complaints of sexual discrimination at the workplace like the one brought by {{Paula Jones}}. {{Paula Jones}} lawyers said Friday that the decision on whether to appeal the case rests solely with {{Paula Jones}} and will probably be made next week. {{Paula Jones}} must appeal within 30 days from Wednesday, the day when Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the sexual misconduct case. Ms. Wright rejected all of the claims stemming from what {{Paula Jones}} said was a 1991 encounter with Clinton in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel suite. The judge said that even if {{Paula Jones}} assertion that {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} made a crude sexual advance in the suite was true, there was no evidence that it constituted sexual harassment. {{Lynne Bernabei}}, a lawyer based in Washington who specializes in sexual harassment cases, said {{Lynne Bernabei}} believed that Ms. Wright left little room for an appeal, adding that it was unlikely the ruling would be overturned. \"The fact that the judge gave {{Paula Jones}} side so much leeway in discovery proceedings to prove their case will make it that much harder to overturn,\" {{Lynne Bernabei}} said. Other legal experts said the 8th Circuit judges had created a strong record in favor of defendants in employment discrimination cases, which is {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} role in this case. \"Given that this circuit has been trying to cut back on the ease with which people can bring these suits, you could say this would be an easy case to affirm,\" said {{Roger Goldman}}, {{Roger Goldman}}. \"But if you look at the political side of things, that would cut in the other direction. Almost all the judges who are not recused on this matter were appointed by either Bush or {{Ronald Reagan}} and to the extent that politics makes a difference, that would cut in the other direction.\" {{Roger Goldman}} was referring to the fact that just three of the 10 active judges on the appeals court have been appointed by Democratic presidents, and two of the three have made it known they would not participate in any cases involving {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}. A similar view to {{Roger Goldman}} was offered by {{Leland Ware}}. \"The 8th Circuit has been pretty rigorous about affirming summary-judgment rulings in employment discrimination cases,\" {{Leland Ware}} said in an interview. \"This is a defendant-friendly circuit in these kinds of cases.\" But he said many lawyers who practice before the 8th Circuit believed that its judges were not favorably disposed toward {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}. \"That's what makes this such an interesting call,\" he said. Among the cases {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} has lost before the 8th Circuit was one in which a three-judge panel overruled Ms. Wright in January 1996. In a 2 - 1 ruling, that panel said the {{Paula Jones}} lawsuit should not be delayed until the end of {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} tenure as president, and ordered the case to go forward. Its decision was upheld by a unanimous Supreme Court. In April 1997, another panel voted 2 - 1 against the White House when it said that notes taken by government lawyers of their conversations with {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} could not be withheld from {{Kenneth Starr}}, {{Kenneth Starr}}. And in a third case, in March 1996, a unanimous three-judge panel ruled in favor of {{Kenneth Starr}} expanding {{Kenneth Starr}} investigation and took the unusual step of removing the lower-court judge from the case because he had spoken of his admiration for {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} and had spent a night as a guest at the {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} White House. Judge {{Pasco Bowman II}}, who was appointed by {{Ronald Reagan}}, was {{Pasco Bowman II}}. {{Pasco Bowman II}} was also {{Pasco Bowman II}} that overruled Ms. Wright in 1996, and that panel could inherit any appeal from {{Paula Jones}}. Court officials said that if for some reason the same panel did not hear the {{Paula Jones}} case, the clerk would then be obliged to choose a new three-judge panel by lottery. In any event, the appeals court could not hear arguments in the case until next fall at the earliest, some court officials said Friday."

        "MINNEAPOLIS _ With a smiling, joyous performance that bore none of the caution she displayed at the Nagano Olympics, {{Michelle Kwan}} decisively won the women's short program Friday at the world figure skating championships. On an otherwise inelegant afternoon, when only four of the 30 skaters delivered clean programs, {{Michelle Kwan}} received a perfect mark of 6 for artistry from the Canadian judge. Inexplicably, one judge placed {{Michelle Kwan}} second, but the other eight placed {{Michelle Kwan}} where {{Michelle Kwan}} clearly belonged _ in first, over Anna Rechnio of Poland and Laetitia Hubert of France. Skating to a Rachmaninoff piano trio and concerto, Kwan showed none of the deliberateness that cost {{Michelle Kwan}} a gold medal at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, in February. {{Michelle Kwan}} was elegant, confident and fast on Friday, with exquisite position and flow in {{Michelle Kwan}} triple lutz-double toe combination and with a graceful, extended spiral that drew customary applause from the audience at the Target Center. {{Michelle Kwan}} wobbled slightly upon landing {{Michelle Kwan}} double axel, but otherwise {{Michelle Kwan}} was at {{Michelle Kwan}} self-assured best. {{Tara Lipinski}}, the Olympic gold medalist, was absent, having withdrawn with sickness and fatigue. But {{Tara Lipinski}} had not defeated Kwan in a short program this season, and it was unlikely that {{Tara Lipinski}} could have prevailed Friday. \"Knowing that the world championships were in {{Michelle Kwan}} home country meant a lot,\" said {{Michelle Kwan}}, who is 17 and lives in Lake Arrowhead, Calif. \"When {{Michelle Kwan}} stepped on the ice, {{Michelle Kwan}} saw the American flags and the banners and {{Michelle Kwan}} wanted to give the audience the joy and freedom that {{Michelle Kwan}} have on the ice.\" Saturday's long program will be worth two-thirds of the scoring. {{Michelle Kwan}} is a heavy favorite to win {{Michelle Kwan}} second world title. {{Anna Rechnio}} are {{Anna Rechnio}}itia Hubert}}, who finished 19th and 20th, respectively, at the Olympics. {{Anna Rechnio}}, 20, did not even qualify for the previous two world championships, where {{Anna Rechnio}} best career finish is 14th. {{Anna Rechnio}} had trained for several seasons in Marlboro, Mass., but this season {{Anna Rechnio}} returned to Warsaw, changed coaches, got injured and missed the European championships. Now healthy, {{Anna Rechnio}} landed spectacular jumps Friday and vaulted into second place. {{Laetitia Hubert}}, 23, is {{Laetitia Hubert}}. At the 1992 Winter Games in {{Anna Rechnio}} native France, {{Anna Rechnio}} fell a half-dozen times in the long program and was nicknamed \"The Human Zamboni.\" At the Nagano Games, {{Anna Rechnio}} became so deflated with {{Anna Rechnio}} poor jumping that {{Anna Rechnio}} appeared on the verge of stopping in the middle of {{Anna Rechnio}} long program. But {{Anna Rechnio}} also defeated {{Tara Lipinski}} at Trophy Lalique in Paris last November. Friday, {{Laetitia Hubert}} was one of only two skaters to land a triple-triple combination. {{Julianna Beke}}, the Hungarian judge, even placed {{Julianna Beke}} first, ahead of {{Michelle Kwan}}. {{Michelle Kwan}} only problem came in the draw for Saturday's long program. {{Michelle Kwan}} drew first in the final group of skaters, which {{Michelle Kwan}} had done at the Winter Olympics. \"We'll have to go home and work on that,\" {{Michelle Kwan}} said with a laugh."

        "WASHINGTON _ Investigators from {{Kenneth Starr}} questioned Monica Lewinsky's mother again Friday but outside the foreboding confines of the grand jury room, according to lawyers close to {{Kenneth Starr}}.

According to U.S. News &AMP; World Report, some people in {{Kenneth Starr}} office want the grand jury to indict {{Monica Lewinsky}} and name the president as an unindicted co-conspirator. That way, the findings against {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} would have a public airing in a courtroom, but there would be no need to address the unanswered constitutional issue of whether a sitting president can be indicted. Other aides to {{Kenneth Starr}} favor turning the evidence over to Congress, according to the magazine, which reported on the supposed debate in {{Kenneth Starr}} office on the Internet. Those aides are said to feel that leaving the president's fate to Congress _ assuming there is sufficient evidence to charge him _ would be the best course, even though many political observers doubt that Congress would impeach Clinton in this election year, especially since he is enjoying high ratings in the polls. Asked at a news conference Friday about the article, {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} declined to comment. {{Kenneth Starr}} has been under mounting criticism since a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., threw out {{Paula Jones}} by {{Paula Jones}}, {{Paula Jones}} accusations {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} has denied. {{Kenneth Starr}} has said that {{Kenneth Starr}} investigation will go on, regardless of the dismissal of {{Paula Jones}}. They are separate matters, although it has often been difficult to tell how separate. {{Kenneth Starr}} began as an investigation into financial dealings of {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} and {{Kenneth Starr}} wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, years ago in Arkansas and has delved in recent months into {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} sexual behavior. The people involved in {{Paula Jones}} and in the episodes that {{Kenneth Starr}} has been studying have occasionally overlapped. {{Kenneth Starr}} was {{Kenneth Starr}} before U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. {{Kenneth Starr}} has subpoenaed the records of Kramerbooks and Afterwords, an independent store in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood, as well as records from Barnes &AMP; Noble, to review {{Monica Lewinsky}} book purchases of the past two and a half years. That is roughly the time in which {{Monica Lewinsky}} is said to have told friends, including one who taped {{Monica Lewinsky}} phone calls, that {{Monica Lewinsky}} had a relationship with {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}. Friday's hearing dealt only with the Kramerbooks subpoena, and it saw lawyers for {{Monica Lewinsky}} and for Kramerbooks standing in unity. \"{{Monica Lewinsky}}'s not been charged with anything,\" one of Ms. {{Monica Lewinsky}} lawyers, {{Nathaniel Speights}}, said, asserting that {{Nathaniel Speights}} client \"has the right to have {{Monica Lewinsky}} privacy protected by this court.\" \"Our ability to read is exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when the Bill of Rights was written,\" Pamela Bethel, a lawyer for Kramerbooks, argued. But {{Robert Bittman}}, {{Robert Bittman}}, said the grand jury needed the list of purchases {{Monica Lewinsky}} made in order to corroborate other evidence. \"{{Kenneth Starr}}'s not {{Kenneth Starr}}, {{Kenneth Starr}}'s {{Kenneth Starr}} that we're looking at,\" {{Robert Bittman}} said. Ms. Johnson said she would rule in about a week."

        "CHICAGO _ With two outs in the top of the seventh inning on Friday at Wrigley Field, the sold-out crowd rose to its feet and began to cheer, eagerly anticipating the seventh-inning stretch and a tradition made famous at this park by {{Harry Caray}}. But following {{Harry Caray}} death two months ago at 83, Cubs fans turned out at the team's home opener on Friday to listen to {{Harry Caray}} widow, Dutchie, sing \"Take {{Harry Caray}} Out to the Ball Game,\" which her husband had spent 16 years crooning to the delight of adoring, jubilant fans. The cheers and chants of \"{{Harry Caray}}, {{Harry Caray}},\" grew louder and the intensity increased so much in the seventh inning that when Montreal's Chris Widger hit a routine fly ball to {{Sammy Sosa}} in right field, {{Sammy Sosa}} dropped it, prolonging the wait. In the broadcast booth, {{Harry Caray}} waited nervously for her debut. It wasn't until after a walk of the following batter and a pitching change that the half -inning finally ended and she assumed the spot {{Harry Caray}} had made famous, leaning out of the booth, microphone waving. Her voice was lost among the 39,102 fans, all of whom were singing along. As the song ended, balloons were released over the field as \"Amazing Grace\" played over the loudspeakers. \"He was guiding me,\" she said following her performance. \"It was a great feeling. To see how much these fans loved {{Harry Caray}} is just amazing.\" The day was an all-out tribute to {{Harry Caray}}, whose love for the game and eccentric personality brought fans from all over to watch a team known for losing. Indeed, {{Harry Caray}} caricatured face that has come to resemble \"fun at the old ball park,\" was omnipresent here on Friday. {{Harry Caray}} face appeared on a patch on players' sleeves, {{Harry Caray}} trademark glasses were worn by fans, and a giant poster of {{Harry Caray}} hung above his broadcast booth, now occupied by his 33-year -old grandson, Chip. With a moment of silence before the game, {{Harry Caray}} was remembered by the people {{Harry Caray}} exemplified: baseball fans. \"Today was a day {{Harry Caray}} was looking forward to for a long time,\" {{Harry Caray}} said before the game. \"It was supposed to be the first day {{Harry Caray}} grandpa and {{Harry Caray}} worked together.\" The Cubs have lined up a number of celebrities to come in and sing, including Ernie Banks on Saturday. Also on tap: the comedian Jay Leno, the film critic Roger Ebert, the singer Lou Rawls, the Olympic speed-skater Bonnie Blair, and the former Chicago Bear Walter Payton. Many of the Cubs faithful would tell you that {{Harry Caray}} was there, maybe even pulling a few strings as Chicago beat the Expos, 6 - 2, improving its record to 3 - 1. Perhaps it was the 18-mph wind blowing straight in from center field ({{Steve Trachsel}}, the Cubs ' starting pitcher, led the National League in home runs allowed last year), or the fact that {{Steve Trachsel}} had three runs batted in. \"{{Harry Caray}} would have been very happy with today,\" said Matt Wolf, who traveled from North Carolina with {{Laura}}, {{Laura}}, for the game. \"We normally come up for two or three games a year, but we knew we had to be here for this. It was just wild.\""

        "&UR; ({{Terry PACE}} is {{Terry PACE}}. This story was distributed by The N.Y. Times News Service.) &LR; FLORENCE, Ala. _ From the area's earliest movie houses to the development of the region's first modern library, the legacy established by Florence businessman Louis Rosenbaum has enhanced quality of life here for three generations. As the century draws to a close, the {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} family hopes to transform one of their long-treasured possessions _ the Usonian-style family home designed by {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} _ into a vital cultural resource for generations to come. \"What {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} really want is to give the house away so that it can be restored and maintained,\" said {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}, who has lived in the house since its construction began in 1939. \"{{Frank Lloyd Wright}} don't have the funds needed to restore the house, so {{Frank Lloyd Wright}}'d like to see it fully restored and turned into a house museum that people can fully enjoy.\" Plans for the transfer of the historic home are being coordinated by {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} sons, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} and founding president of the National Center for Heritage Development. \"This house is a very important example of American architecture,\" maintains {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}, whose comprehensive book, \"{{Frank Lloyd Wright}} Design for America,\" was published in 1993. \"It needs to be saved and taken care of and made available to the public.\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} were {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}w Dr. in Florence. In {{Stanley Rosenbaum}} book, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} described {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} unique Usonian concept as \"... a place where design commingled with nature, expanding the idea of architecture to include a civilization, a utopian ideal that integrated spiritual harmony and material prosperity across a seamless, unspoiled landscape.\" As {{Stanley Rosenbaum}} developed the Rosenbaums ' future home, {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} envisioned the structure as a prototype for {{Stanley Rosenbaum}} daring new approach to residential design for middle-class Americans. \"The {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} house is the purest example of the Usonian,\" Cambridge University scholar and architect John Sargeant proclaimed in \"{{Frank Lloyd Wright}} Usonian Houses,\" a book published in 1976. \"It incorporates detailing improvements and combines all the standard elements in a mature and spatially varied interior.\" The house has been owned by the {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} family since its construction, and {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} has been quoted by Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation archivist Bruce Brooks Pfeiffer as calling the couple \"ideal clients\" who \"lived appropriately and beautifully in {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} home.\" In a rare move, {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} designed an addition to the house in 1945 when {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} family of four sons had outgrown the space. Today the {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} house enjoys the distinction of being the only {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} -designed structure in Alabama and the only pre-World War II {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} house that is still occupied by its original owner. \"{{Frank Lloyd Wright}} showed the house to people from the very beginning, because people just asked out of curiosity,\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} recalled. \"It was unlike anything this area had ever seen. They couldn't imagine what was behind that blank wall in front. They either rang the bell or knocked on the door and asked, 'May {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} come in and see?' {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} allowed them to for years. Then, after {{Stanley Rosenbaum}} passed away, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} just didn't feel up to it.\" Since 1991 _ after an open house drew an overwhelming single-afternoon crowd of 800 people _ {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} has served as a live-in curator and tale-spinning tour guide, offering fascinating, firsthand remembrances of the house, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} family and {{Frank Lloyd Wright}} himself. Over the past seven years, the Rosenbaum House has been visited by close to 5,000 tourists representing 48 states and 20 foreign countries. \"These people came to see the Rosenbaum House,\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} noted, \"but they also came to be a part of the W.C. Handy Music Festival, or to see Wilson Dam, to fish or swim, to stay overnight or to spend part of their family vacation here in the Shoals. Those things have a tremendous economic impact on an area _ much more than they're usually given credit for.\" With that in mind, the family hopes to see the proposed {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} house museum developed in conjunction with a broad-based community partnership focusing on the benefits of cultural tourism. Supporters say the restoration of the {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} house will be accompanied by the development of educational and cultural-outreach programs. In January, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} and {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} discussed the future of the house with representatives of the Florence -based Frank Lloyd Wright Rosenbaum House Foundation as well as local leaders in business, education, tourism, historic preservation and the arts. Since that time, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} has been engaged in assembling a planning team and soliciting support for the project from potential funding sources across the country. \"Initially, I've had substantial expressions of interest and some very good responses,\" he said. \"However, I think that there is a truism that national foundations and funding sources are only available to the extent that there is local commitment. These days, public-sector support is not as important as individual people. And the issue is not just financial. It involves partnerships and cooperative relationships with other organizations, so that we're not duplicating efforts that are already being done.\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} believes his family's cherished home _ which celebrates its landmark 60th anniversary next year _ can be developed as \"the hub for a region-wide heritage initiative\" that encompasses all of the cultural attractions in the Shoals _ from the Helen Keller birthplace in Tuscumbia to the Renaissance Tower in Florence as well as the various gospel sings, barbecue suppers and bass-fishing tournaments that define the area's local color. \"Just doing the project isn't enough,\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} added. \"You have to do it in such a way that it's sustainable and part of an overall plan for the entire area. {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} just talked to {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} 7-year -old on the phone. When he's 67, the house needs to be here, pristine, telling the story that's part of his life.\" For his recent return to the Shoals, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} was joined by {{J. Jackson Walter}}, who served as president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation for seven years. {{J. Jackson Walter}}, who {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} insists \"wrote the book on how historic preservation is now practiced in the United States,\" is helping the family organize a steering committee for the Campaign to Save the Rosenbaum House. \"I came predisposed to the proposition that the house should be preserved,\" admitted {{J. Jackson Walter}}, who now heads the Waterford Foundation in historic Waterford, Va., a town that has been designated as a National Historic Landmark. \"Now that I've been here, what's interesting to me is the actual context _ the way this house and this family fit into the history of this area. There's so much here _ from the TVA story to the music industry _ and it's a very interesting mix. I suspect that the restoration of this house will have a catalytic effect on the understanding of the Muscle Shoals area and how it presents itself to the larger public.\" On a personal level, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} wants the restoration of the house to continue a long-standing family tradition of \"building the character of this community.\" His grandfather, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}, introduced movies to the Shoals and helped support institutions ranging from churches to libraries. His father, {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}, retired from the movie-theater business and launched an even more fulfilling career as a professor of English literature at the University of North Alabama. \"{{Mildred Rosenbaum}} father was an educator, and as anyone who's visited here can tell you, books practically hold the house up,\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} observed. \"This house was full of college students and other friends talking about ideas, enjoying an intellectual atmosphere and participating in a certain quality that this house eked out of people. That, to {{Mildred Rosenbaum}}, is the most important part of the legacy.\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} also considers the restoration project a tribute to the spirit and dedication of his mother, who turned 80 last year and continues to conduct public tours of the house _ by appointment only _ on a regular basis. Just last month, the Alabama Bureau of Tourism and Travel named {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} _ an honor citing individuals who \"make a very positive impression\" on visitors to the state. \"Certainly the house without {{Mimi}} is not the same thing as the house with {{Mimi}},\" {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} admits. \"{{Mimi}} will be involved in every aspect of this so long as {{Mimi}} is able to be involved _ which {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} would predict is to {{Mimi}} dying day. {{Mildred Rosenbaum}} hope that's not for a long time.\""

An official washout was declared about 4:30 p.m. and both singles matches were postponed until Saturday because the team captains refused to start a match under the lights. \"The guys like to acclimate to the conditions, and nobody has hit one practice ball at night under the lights,\" said {{Tom Gullikson}}, {{Tom Gullikson}}.

        "NEW YORK _ {{Eyad Ismoil}}, {{Eyad Ismoil}}, was sentenced on Friday to 240 years in prison. In handing down the sentence, Judge Kevin T. Duffy of U.S. District Court in Manhattan rejected {{Eyad Ismoil}} that he had not received a fair trial, as well as his lawyer's argument that {{Eyad Ismoil}} was not {{Eyad Ismoil}}ef}}, who was convicted along with him in November. \"What you did was a sneak attack,\" Duffy said. \"What you did was to kill innocents. What you sought to do was to kill innocents.\" The judge also imposed a $250,000 fine, and ordered {{Eyad Ismoil}} to pay $10 million in restitution _ \"just to make sure that you never make a dime out of this,\" he said. During the proceeding, {{Eyad Ismoil}}, the last of six defendants convicted of carrying out the bombing plot, continued to assert {{Eyad Ismoil}} innocence. \"Jail {{Eyad Ismoil}}, and you will add one number to the wrong list,\" {{Eyad Ismoil}} said. \"But don't think that you will ever rest, because tyrants always end up in trouble.\" He said that the charges were false and that they would \"fade like a bubble.\" \"In this world,\" he said, \"a fair trial is always rare.\" The judge dismissed {{Eyad Ismoil}}. \"You have received an extraordinarily fair trial, something which was done not as a show trial but to give you the opportunity to put forward whatever you wanted to do,\" he said. Under the rules of the federal system, {{Eyad Ismoil}} will not be eligible for parole, and is likely to spend the rest of {{Eyad Ismoil}} life in prison. {{Eyad Ismoil}} sentence matches the 240-year -terms imposed on the five other men convicted in the bombing. The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, whose office prosecuted the case, said the sentence \"once again sends a clear message that this country will respond to terrorist acts with the full force of the law.\" {{Eyad Ismoil}} did not testify in the trial, but {{Louis R. Aidala}}, {{Louis R. Aidala}}, often sought to distance {{Louis R. Aidala}} client from {{Ramzi Yousef}}, portraying {{Louis R. Aidala}} as a naive 21-year -old Jordanian who came to the United States to get an education and a job, and got swept into the conspiracy. {{Eyad Ismoil}} said there was no evidence that {{Eyad Ismoil}} was a religious or political fanatic, like {{Ramzi Yousef}}. Prosecutors said {{Eyad Ismoil}} was working in Texas when {{Eyad Ismoil}} was called by {{Ramzi Yousef}} and asked to help in the plot. {{Eyad Ismoil}} told authorities after {{Eyad Ismoil}} arrest that {{Eyad Ismoil}} believed {{Eyad Ismoil}} was transporting boxes of soap into the World Trade Center garage as part of a business deal, the jury was told. During Friday's proceeding, {{Louis R. Aidala}} again questioned whether there was sufficient evidence that {{Eyad Ismoil}} knew {{Eyad Ismoil}} was participating in a bombing. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelley argued that the jury had made fair conclusions from the circumstantial evidence. The judge agreed and then echoed statements that he had made in {{Ramzi Yousef}} in January, when he said that the convicted terrorist had worshiped the god of \"death and destruction.\" \"You were like {{Ramzi Yousef}} because your god was evil,\" the judge told Ismoil on Friday. \"I am not talking about an evil god; I am talking about the personification of evil.\""

        "WASHINGTON _ When the dust settled this week after the House passed its mammoth $217 billion, six-year highway bill, most New York lawmakers walked away ecstatic about the millions they managed to reap for their state. The bill has 47 percent more for New York state than did the last highway bill, passed in 1991, including $652.2 million from a $9 billion provision for special projects. One clear reason for the increase is simple politics: The House Transportation Committee includes five New York members, four of them Republicans. The sums could change once members of the House and Senate meet to work out the differences in their two bills, including the fate of all the special projects, but legislators are optimistic. \"New York fared a heck of a lot better than we had any reason to expect,\" said Rep. {{Jerrold Nadler}}, D- New York City. Most of the millions in special projects would go toward much-needed asphalt-and-steel staples, like highway construction, bridges, parking lots and bus stations, but the bill also includes $40 million for a new Staten Island ferry in New York City. Legislation of such mammoth proportions always covers a few unusual projects. For example, the Calspan University of Buffalo Research Center, a nonprofit organization run jointly with the State University at Buffalo, N.Y., would receive $12 million to help create the Center for Transportation Injury Research. The center, according to a recent news release, will work to \"find ways to get the right type of emergency response to an accident scene more quickly.\" The cries of a small band of vocal opponents of big spending did little to temper the House's overall enthusiasm for the bill, which passed 337 - 80. New York City would see dozens of improvements. Houston Street, for one, would be given wider sidewalks and improved stoplights at a cost of $2 million. The 79th Street traffic circle off the West Side Highway would be rebuilt for $9 million, and the Frederick Douglass Circle at the northwest corner of Central Park would be improved, for $14.65 million. {{Jerrold Nadler}} arranged for $19 million for barge companies carrying rail freight cars across the harbor between Brooklyn and New Jersey. {{Jerrold Nadler}} also had $24 million included for a study of the cost of digging a tunnel to replace the elevated section of the Gowanus Expressway, which residents call an eyesore. Members of Congress \"know what their districts need as well as or better than anyone else,\" {{Jerrold Nadler}} said. \"When members go home and they say {{Jerrold Nadler}} got this or that, they better be reasonable projects or they will be criticized back home for it.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Overall, New York did well. In addition to the money for special projects, the state would receive $7.34 billion for mass transit and $10.57 billion for highways. But it was the special projects that most interested members of Congress. Rep. {{Sherwood Boehlert}}, R- Utica, N.Y., who is the fourth- ranking member of the House Transportation Committee, secured the most money in the New York delegation, bringing back $65 million for new roads, bridges and an assortment of other projects. \"{{Sherwood Boehlert}} take great pride that {{Sherwood Boehlert}} come out No. 1,\" {{Sherwood Boehlert}} said. \"It's not just a back-of-the-envelope exercise in the chairman's office in the wee hours of the evening. This was two years in the making.\" The lone New York congressman to oppose the measure, Rep. {{John LaFalce}}, D- Buffalo, N.Y., said he voted against it to protest its conspicuous largesse. Critics said the bill threatened to bust the federal budget, which was finally balanced last year, and cut into important domestic programs. House and Senate negotiators have yet to decide where to make the cuts, although the bill's drafters and supporters say that gas taxes will pay for the special projects. \"We experience the gain now, but we don't decide who experiences the pain later,\" {{John LaFalce}} said. \"That's not prudent. That's not fiscal discipline.\" The biggest items usually involve roads and bridges. Buffalo, for example, would get $16 million for a new outer harbor bridge, courtesy of Rep. Jack Quinn, R- Buffalo, a member of the Transportation Committee. The Grand Concourse in the Bronx, in New York City, would get a redesigned look to \"enhance traffic flow\" for another $16 million. In {{Sherwood Boehlert}} upstate New York district, the Utica to Rome expressway in Oneida County would be improved for $20 million. Universities even got on the list. Fordham would get $2 million for a large parking lot that is near bus and rail stations. And there is $12 million for the State University at Buffalo's little-known National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research. The center plans to use the money to conduct research to reduce the \"seismic vulnerability of the national highway system.\""

        "NEW YORK _ {{Moe Foner}} sat in the glow of sunshine inside {{Moe Foner}} office, where papers, posters and plaques were scattered about. {{Moe Foner}} was on the phone or, more accurately, on hold, waiting for a car-service dispatcher to get back to {{Moe Foner}}. A heart condition and walking pneumonia make it hard for {{Moe Foner}} to get around. \"{{Moe Foner}} can't take public transportation,\" {{Moe Foner}} said, {{Moe Foner}} patience wearing a bit thin. \"Oh, {{Moe Foner}}'ll do it some other time.\" {{Moe Foner}} hung up and rooted around the papers on {{Moe Foner}} desk. \"{{Moe Foner}} know about the rally on Saturday?\" {{Moe Foner}} asked, holding out a flier plucked from the pile. On it was a picture of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. above the words \"We March to Keep His Dream Alive.\" {{Moe Foner}}, 82, may not be able to do much marching these days, but {{Moe Foner}} does what {{Moe Foner}} can to fulfill the last half of that declaration. For decades {{Moe Foner}} was second in command at 1199, the hospital workers union, witnessing a tumultuous era when it went from representing drugstore clerks and pharmacists to winning collective bargaining rights for thousands of low-paid, behind-the-scenes workers at nonprofit hospitals. In those rocky times, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}e of the labor movement.\" Today, 30 years after {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., people may recall what the civil-rights leader did for the cause of racial equality. But people like {{Moe Foner}} will never forget what {{Moe Foner}} did for organized labor, a struggle that {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} cast in terms of human rights and dignity. \"Some people know very little about {{Martin Luther King Jr.}},\" said {{Moe Foner}}, who directs the union's Bread and Roses project, which takes culture to the work place. \"{{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was involved with many unions. When {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was shot down in Memphis, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was supporting the sanitation workers, who were on strike. But {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} association with us was special.\" When the two men met in 1959, the union was trying to organize in seven hospitals, despite the obstacles posed by reluctant managers and laws that excluded employees of nonprofit hospitals from labor laws. \"They were at the bottom of the ladder,\" {{Moe Foner}} recalled. \"They received $26 a week and had no protection. Everybody said to us: Don't touch the hospitals. The workers won't stick together because they're poor. Even assuming you get a majority, the hospitals don't have to agree to an election. And if you go on strike, all you'll get is injunctions, jailings and fines.\" Although the hospital workers were receptive to the union's overtures, {{Moe Foner}} and {{Moe Foner}} colleagues decided they needed to open another front in their campaign. They suspected that organizing low-paid minority workers would not be enough to sway the boards that ran the institutions. \"We had to get the public's support, so that could have a moral effect on management,\" {{Moe Foner}} said. \"You're dealing with trustees of hospitals that can call up and speak to the mayor and governor. The Who's Who of America, those people.\" {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} knew about the union, and {{Moe Foner}} was invited to meet with {{Moe Foner}} at the home of {{Stanley Levison}}, {{Stanley Levison}}. At that meeting, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} offered to write a letter of support which the union widely circulated. By 1962, when the union was lobbying to amend state laws to allow collective bargaining for hospital workers, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} called Gov. Nelson Rockefeller three times to urge {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} support. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} often visited with union members and officials, and {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} last major speech in New York City was at a union rally the month before {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was killed. In it, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} boasted that {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} considered {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} \"a fellow 1199 -er.\" {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} mentioned that any talk of urban unrest and \"long, hot summers,\" should also consider what was done during the \"long, cold winters\" that preceded them. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} talked about how people worked full-time jobs for part-time pay. \"People are always talking about menial labor,\" {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} told the audience. \"But no labor is really menial unless you're not getting adequate wages.\" Three and a half weeks later, he was dead. The union he helped is now the city's largest, and its headquarters bears his name. Not that {{Moe Foner}} needs any reminders. {{Moe Foner}}'ll be at Saturday's rally, even if walking a block leaves {{Moe Foner}} short of breath. \"Labor has to show it's really interested in people,\" {{Moe Foner}} said. \"There are remarkable people around. You shouldn't have to wait until they die to tell them.\""

        "NEW YORK _ It was easier for {{Chris Childs}} to be with the Nets two years ago. Less pressure, no hype. Having freedom from expectation meant wowing everyone as a playmaking guard with a freewheeling style. He lost his anonymity that summer when he signed a $24 million deal with the Knicks. He went just across the river, but to another world, as a high-profile point guard. He has been adjusting ever since. This injury-riddled season, in which he went from starter to backup, has been particularly difficult and increasingly dreadful for {{Chris Childs}}. In his last three games, {{Chris Childs}} has made four of 17 shots and committed seven turnovers in 68 minutes of playing time. \"{{Chris Childs}}'m not happy with the way {{Chris Childs}}'m playing,\" {{Chris Childs}} said after an 0 -for- 2, three-turnover performance against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night. \"{{Chris Childs}}'m not getting the ball to the basket. {{Chris Childs}} leg is not hurting as much as it did before, so {{Chris Childs}}'ve got to get there. {{Chris Childs}}'m going to play {{Chris Childs}} game on Saturday.\" If {{Chris Childs}} does, {{Chris Childs}} return to the Childs of old will take place Saturday night at Continental Arena, where {{Chris Childs}} was so comfortable with the Nets. As much as {{Chris Childs}} has struggled as a Knick _ not clicking with either the {{Patrick Ewing}} -oriented offense or the current one without the injured center _ {{Chris Childs}} is only half of the point guard problem. {{Charlie Ward}}, the starter, has also hit a season-low lull. At times, {{Charlie Ward}} has been clutch in {{Charlie Ward}} shots and smart in {{Charlie Ward}} passes off penetration. But over the same three games that {{Chris Childs}} game has worsened, {{Charlie Ward}} shooting has been worse. {{Chris Childs}} has made one of 15 shots and is 0 for 5 from 3-point range. \"I'm not really worried about their scoring,\" Knicks coach {{Jeff Van Gundy}} said. \"Charlie is aggressive and looks for other guys. We just want to make sure he maintains the right balance and takes his own shot when he's open. \"{{Chris Childs}} has got to play through it and keep working.\" That means doing the extra shooting {{Jeff Van Gundy}} has been banging the drum for lately. As a team, particularly in the backcourt over the last week, the Knick players' shots have fallen hard on the rim. Now is not the time for an offensive swoon, not when the Knicks are trying to hold fast to a playoff position. Teams like the eighth-place Nets are in the chase for the Knicks ' No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference. \"Before, we were in the favorite's position,\" said {{Jeff Van Gundy}}, whose team held a three-and-a-half-game lead over the Nets. \"They were always the underdog. {{Jeff Van Gundy}} think that's all changed.\" So much has changed since {{Chris Childs}} was with the Nets. With the Knicks, it is not so easy to be {{Chris Childs}}. \"{{Chris Childs}} was brought here for other aspects of {{Chris Childs}} game; {{Chris Childs}}'ve got to show that,\" said {{Chris Childs}}, who admits the ankle that {{Chris Childs}} sprained six weeks ago is not what is bothering {{Chris Childs}} now. \"{{Chris Childs}}'ve been stagnate, not playing {{Chris Childs}} game. That is going to end on Saturday.\" REBOUNDS {{Patrick Ewing}} continued to go through shooting drills Friday at practice and ran through some plays with the team. A team official said Thursday night that {{Patrick Ewing}} is expected to return to a full-contact practice within 10 days, the final step for a return before the playoffs. \"{{Jeff Van Gundy}} expect he'll practice before the end of the season at some point,\" {{Jeff Van Gundy}} said Friday before describing {{Patrick Ewing}} workout. \"When we went contact, he didn't play. If he's able to, contact would be the next step. It would be a huge step.\" Barring a setback to his surgically repaired shooting wrist, {{Patrick Ewing}} could be in uniform for one of the Knicks ' final regular-season games. {{Patrick Ewing}} touch was in full view before the Knicks ' 81 - 70 victory over the Clippers on Thursday, when {{Patrick Ewing}} shot 10 - to 18-foot jumpers for about half an hour and looked surprisingly smooth in {{Patrick Ewing}} release."

        "OAKLAND, {{Joe Torre}} Yankee cap was tilted back high on {{Joe Torre}} forehead after Thursday night's 10 - 2 loss to the Angels in Anaheim, a dumbfounded expression overwhelming {{Joe Torre}} face. With a beer in {{Joe Torre}} hand, {{Joe Torre}} could have been a dead ringer for Walter Matthau as the manager of the Bad News Bears. \"They kicked our rears,\" {{Joe Torre}} said. \"We didn't help matters any.\" The Yankees can blame El Nino. They can blame the American League schedule. They can blame themselves. Regardless, they arrived here Friday after having lost the first two games of a season of high hopes with a toothless offensive attack and sometimes brainless play on defense. \"It was an ugly game,\" said {{David Cone}}, who makes {{David Cone}} first start Saturday against Oakland. \"An ugly way to lose; it was embarrassing. It was the type of game that you hope could be a wake-up call. \"Nonetheless, I still like this team.\" {{Derek Jeter}}, {{Derek Jeter}}, reiterated what {{Joe Torre}} had mentioned, that the Yankees ' preparation was affected by the El Nino-driven rain last weekend in San Diego, all the hours of batting and infield practice washed away. {{George Steinbrenner}}, {{George Steinbrenner}}, said Thursday {{George Steinbrenner}} would request that {{George Steinbrenner}} team open at Yankee Stadium next season. The 1997 opener was indoors, in Seattle. The Yankees went 4 - 4 on that first West Coast swing, while Baltimore _ which always opens at Camden Yards _ jumped ahead in the standing. Every trip to the West Coast in recent years has challenged the Yankees, who are 64 - 83 on this side of the country in the 1990s. Rain, West Coast, whatever, the Yankees are 0 - 2. {{Ramiro Mendoza}}, {{Ramiro Mendoza}}, started Friday night against the Athletics. In Thursday's defeat, there were no errors charged to the Yankees. But they played miserably, making more mistakes in one game than in the final two weeks of spring training. In the first inning, the Yankees threatened. {{Derek Jeter}} singled and Paul O'Neill walked with one out. {{Bernie Williams}} smashed a line drive to center field, where {{Jim Edmonds}} stepped forward and caught the ball neck-high. {{Derek Jeter}}, running on contact, was almost at third and was easily doubled off second base to end the inning. Dismissing the unthinkable _ that {{Derek Jeter}} forgot the number of outs _ {{Joe Torre}} said {{Joe Torre}} thought {{Bernie Williams}} liner was going to land for a hit. {{Derek Jeter}} said {{Derek Jeter}} did, too. \"{{Derek Jeter}} was thinking 'score,' even though it was hit hard, and {{Derek Jeter}} was trying to get a good jump,\" {{Derek Jeter}} said. \"{{Jim Edmonds}} caught it like {{Jim Edmonds}} was camped under a fly ball.\" Anaheim scored three runs in the fourth inning against {{David Wells}}, but if the Yankee infielders had made the plays, the damage could have been limited to one run. One out into the inning, Dave Hollins hammered a solo homer. Then Tim Salmon chopped a ball into the shortstop hole, where {{Derek Jeter}} fielded it and fired toward first. The throw skipped in front of first baseman Tino Martinez, who was unable to scoop the ball cleanly. Base hit. After {{David Wells}} walked Cecil Fielder, {{Garret Anderson}} slapped a half-speed grounder up the middle. The chances of an inning-ending double play were marginal, but any shot was lost when {{Derek Jeter}} fumbled the bouncer and settled for the out at first. Instead of being out of the inning, {{David Wells}} had to pitch to Phil Nevin with two runners on and two out, and {{David Wells}} gave up a two-run double. \"That was tough,\" {{Derek Jeter}} said of {{Garret Anderson}}. \"{{Garret Anderson}} hit {{Garret Anderson}} slow.\" But {{David Wells}} accepted {{David Wells}} share of the blame for the three runs; {{David Wells}} threw a fastball with no balls and two strikes to Hollins for the home run and a hanging curveball for Nevin's double. {{Darryl Strawberry}} played alongside each other in spring training without having one ball hit equidistant between {{Darryl Strawberry}}. This occurred twice Thursday, with {{Darryl Strawberry}} catching the first ball and dropping the second, as {{Darryl Strawberry}} avoided collisions with {{Bernie Williams}}. {{Darryl Strawberry}} second play was ruled a triple by Gary DiSarcina, setting up a two-run seventh. In the eighth, {{Scott Brosius}}, {{Scott Brosius}}, fielded a grounder with runners at first and third and the infield in. {{Scott Brosius}} glanced at {{Carlos Garcia}}, {{Carlos Garcia}} at third, before looking to second; {{Scott Brosius}} had forgotten that {{Chuck Knoblauch}} would not be covering the base with the infield in. So {{Scott Brosius}} quickly threw to first. {{Carlos Garcia}} noted {{Scott Brosius}} indecision and scored. As the infielders reset for the next hitter, {{Scott Brosius}} tapped his chest, acknowledging his mistake. Later, {{Darryl Strawberry}} overthrew a cutoff man. \"Hopefully, we got all the garbage out of the way,\" said {{Joe Torre}}, for one night the manager of the bad news Yankees. INSIDE PITCH {{Chili Davis}}, {{Chili Davis}}, left Thursday night's game after {{Chili Davis}} third at-bat with what {{Joe Torre}} described as pain in {{Joe Torre}} right foot. \"{{Chili Davis}} foot was a little numb,\" {{Joe Torre}} said. \"{{Chili Davis}} had {{Chili Davis}} shoe tied a little too tight.\"... The Yankees went 1 for 16 with runners in scoring position in the first two games... {{Chuck Knoblauch}} has reached base in six of his nine plate appearances... {{Orlando Hernandez}}, {{Orlando Hernandez}}, pitched two solid innings in a simulated game against Class A players in Tampa, Fla., allowing two infield hits."

        "NEW ORLEANS _ In a town famous for its flamboyance, {{Susan Spicer}} is the city's stealth chef. Unlike Emeril Legasse or Justin Wilson, {{Susan Spicer}} speaks softly, has no desire to build a restaurant empire and serves neither Cajun nor Creole food. But if {{Susan Spicer}} is quiet and self-deprecating, the food at {{Susan Spicer}} restaurant, {{Bayona}}, shines, and {{Susan Spicer}} is widely regarded as one of the cooking luminaries of New Orleans, and of the nation as well, as {{Susan Spicer}} is routinely cited in surveys of America's best chefs. {{Susan Spicer}} intimate restaurant in the French Quarter is packed nightly with locals as well as tourists who appreciate {{Susan Spicer}} uncluttered cooking, which relies on the goodness of the ingredients and {{Susan Spicer}} captivating approach. {{Susan Spicer}} food reflects {{Susan Spicer}} wide-ranging interests: {{Susan Spicer}} has lived in France and Holland, and has traveled throughout most of the Mediterranean and the United States. From {{Susan Spicer}} mother, who is Danish, she learned variety. \"She was as likely to serve fried chicken as curry,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said. But some of {{Susan Spicer}} food also mirrors a Louisiana sensibility. She uses oysters to stuff roasted quail, and encrusts rabbit with pecans and serves it with a sauce made from Cajun tasso ham. Her Thai spicy shrimp, on the other hand, is brilliantly seasoned and authentically Thai, with beautifully balanced flavors. The presentations are simple and straightforward. No towers of food and other show-off architecture. Success came quickly to {{Susan Spicer}} when {{Susan Spicer}} opened {{Susan Spicer}} own restaurant in 1990, but it was not before years of casting about for a career. {{Susan Spicer}}, 45, considers {{Susan Spicer}} a late bloomer. {{Susan Spicer}} claims to have failed at everything else {{Susan Spicer}} tried. \"{{Susan Spicer}} was {{Susan Spicer}}, and {{Susan Spicer}} was fired, and {{Susan Spicer}} was a bad secretary,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said, a small smile playing around {{Susan Spicer}} mouth. \"So {{Susan Spicer}} could be considered a change-of-career person if {{Susan Spicer}} had ever had a career. {{Susan Spicer}} was {{Susan Spicer}}, and {{Susan Spicer}} was restless. {{Susan Spicer}} started cooking at 26, but {{Susan Spicer}} was always looking for a creative outlet. Nothing came easy.\" {{Susan Spicer}} began {{Susan Spicer}} culinary career in 1979 by apprenticing {{Susan Spicer}} to a French chef in New Orleans. Then {{Susan Spicer}} spent four months working at all the stations in a Parisian restaurant kitchen, knowing that when {{Susan Spicer}} returned to New Orleans {{Susan Spicer}} boss expected {{Susan Spicer}} to become the chef of a restaurant he was opening. {{Susan Spicer}} said {{Susan Spicer}} didn't feel {{Susan Spicer}} was qualified, but the decision was out of {{Susan Spicer}} hands. \"Being a chef when {{Susan Spicer}} felt {{Susan Spicer}} wasn't ready was pretty stressful,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said. \"Everyone {{Susan Spicer}} hired {{Susan Spicer}} thought knew more than {{Susan Spicer}} did. {{Susan Spicer}} was really kind of afraid a lot of the time. So {{Susan Spicer}} left and went back to Europe and worked here and there.\" {{Susan Spicer}} returned to New Orleans a year later and, in 1986, was the opening chef at the Bistro in the Maison de Ville hotel, where {{Susan Spicer}} stayed until {{Bayona}} became a reality. It was an immediate success, turning a profit within six months. Even though {{Bayona}} has a national reputation among the cognoscenti, and even though {{Susan Spicer}} feels \"pretty confident\" about what {{Susan Spicer}} is doing, {{Susan Spicer}} thinks {{Susan Spicer}} has a long way to go. \"{{Bayona}} is still evolving,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said, on a recent afternoon as {{Susan Spicer}} cooked some of {{Susan Spicer}} favorite dishes in the cooking-school kitchen of {{Susan Spicer}} shop, which {{Susan Spicer}} recently opened. \"You have to stay fresh. {{Susan Spicer}} want to keep it that way. {{Susan Spicer}} don't think {{Susan Spicer}} have enough energy to inject into five different projects.\" {{Susan Spicer}} is determined to keep growing as a cook. \"One of the things {{Susan Spicer}}'m good at is putting flavors together,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said. \"{{Susan Spicer}} have good instincts about food and wine, probably from being adventurous at a very young age. {{Susan Spicer}} can sit in {{Susan Spicer}} office and put a menu together. But in terms of technique, {{Susan Spicer}} would like to be more confident.\" {{Susan Spicer}}, who has dark blond hair and intense pale blue eyes, describes {{Susan Spicer}} as shy, but {{Susan Spicer}} does not go unnoticed: people always remember {{Susan Spicer}} because of the band {{Susan Spicer}} wears across {{Susan Spicer}} forehead when {{Susan Spicer}} cooks. Except, of course, in the presence of a reporter, when the headband moves to the back of {{Susan Spicer}} hair, and any leftover hippie traits are disguised. Those who have seen {{Susan Spicer}} conduct a cooking class describe her as lively and funny, sharing intimate secrets of her private life, talking about her younger boyfriend, for example, who is also the manager of her shop. She describes this mingling of her personal and professional lives as \"a pretty dangerous thing to do,\" adding in an offhanded manner that she is \"past the point of worrying about getting married.\" {{Susan Spicer}} came to cooking in spite of {{Susan Spicer}} father and because of {{Susan Spicer}} mother. \"{{Susan Spicer}} dad had really high hopes for {{Susan Spicer}} scholastically,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said. \"{{Susan Spicer}} did well in school. {{Susan Spicer}} skipped a grade when {{Susan Spicer}} was a kid, and he wanted {{Susan Spicer}} to be some sort of engineer, something less earthy than a cook. {{Susan Spicer}} wanted to go to the Culinary Institute of America, but he didn't want to pay for it.\" Despite the lack of the architectural plates that are so in vogue today, despite the fact that the food is neither Cajun nor Creole and that the chef does not have a television cooking series, not even a cookbook, {{Susan Spicer}} patrons have come to trust her. \"I think we keep it interesting enough without intimidating people,\" she said. {{Susan Spicer}} understated style is apparent, too, in the look of {{Susan Spicer}} new shop called Spice Inc. : clean and spare. The shop is taking off, even though its location makes {{Susan Spicer}} an urban pioneer. Spice Inc. opened late last year in a warehouse district on its way to gentrification. The grungy exterior of the historic Cotton Mill Building provides no clue to {{Susan Spicer}} airy shop on the first floor. Sunlight streams in through floor-to-ceiling windows. The loft-like decor _ exposed metal pipes, light woods, a painted cement floor _ provides the background for enticing displays of prepared foods like sesame-crusted tuna, Thai green curry chicken and Shorty's macaroni and cheese as well as an ample selection of fruits, vegetables and cheeses. The shop makes its own European-style bread; it is the first to do so in New Orleans, {{Susan Spicer}} said. Spice could not look more different from {{Bayona}}, which is in the heart of the French Quarter in a 200-year -old Creole cottage with French jalousie doors. The restaurant has three intimate dining rooms, with ceiling fans, terra-cotta walls, crisp white linens and lighting that makes everyone look good. A glassed-in garden room looks out on an incredibly romantic brick-walled garden. Yet, for all its charm, it is as understated as the owner. \"{{Susan Spicer}}'m not looking to provoke,\" {{Susan Spicer}} said. \"{{Susan Spicer}}'m not {{Susan Spicer}}. {{Susan Spicer}}'m glad there are people who do that, but essentially {{Susan Spicer}} just want it to taste good.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE.

        "LOS ANGELES _ The entertainment industry thrives on a thinly disguised hierarchy of exclusivity. Even well-known producers and directors fight ferociously _ through their agents or assistants, of course _ for tickets to major events. Still, {{Jerry Seinfeld}}, has trumped the crowd. The taping of the final segment of the final episode of the show, which is shutting down after nine years, is shrouded in dense secrecy and is proving all but impossible to get into. \"{{Alan Horn}}'ve gotten 89 million calls about it,\" said {{Alan Horn}}.\" \"Shameless? Yes, people are shameless about trying to get in. But it's just a family affair, you know, people who've been connected to the show and families.\" {{Alan Horn}} said {{Alan Horn}} was taking {{Alan Horn}} wife, {{Alan Horn}} two children and another relative. About 250 people have been invited to watch the final taping on Wednesday, all of them connected in some way to the show or its stars: {{Jerry Seinfeld}}, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander and Michael Richards. \"It's closed,\" said {{Elizabeth Clark}}, {{Elizabeth Clark}}. \"Nobody outside the immediate show is going to be allowed in.\" Adding to the aura of secrecy, no scripts are being circulated. Indeed, those who have received scripts have had to sign confidentiality agreements, {{Alan Horn}} said. No one involved would even discuss the contents of the episode, which is to be broadcast on May 14. The show is expected to attract one of the largest television audiences ever. As a result, NBC has reportedly sold advertising at $2 million for a 30-second spot; that is roughly four times the show's usual rate. Security will be extremely tight at Wednesday's taping, and already the producers are bracing for a heavy cordon of television cameras and news crews at the gates of the studio, CBS Studio Center in Studio City. Since the last \"Seinfeld\" episode will be an hour long (one of the few bits of information the people involved would disclose), it is being taped over several nights, not the one night typical for most shows. The script has been written by Larry David, who created the show with {{Jerry Seinfeld}} but left two years ago to work on movies and other projects. The episode will feature the regular cast along with several guest stars who have appeared in previous episodes. But it is not even clear exactly what the audience will see on Wednesday evening. There have been rumors that the concluding moments of the episode will be taped at another time. There is one rumor that the select audience will be shown a tape of a decoy ending, a fake intended to throw snoops off the track in case anyone at the event discloses the story line. (A whole fake script was circulated on the Internet by an unknown author.) The television series, which, in a reflection of the times proudly proclaims that it is a show about nothing, is enormously popular and a huge source of profits for NBC and Castle Rock. Even though no new episodes will be produced after Wednesday, \"{{Jerry Seinfeld}}\" is already proving a great success in syndication. The show, at 9 p.m. on Thursdays, has been a mainstay of one of the most popular nights on network television. Already there are concerns about whether NBC will be able to replace \"{{Jerry Seinfeld}}\" with anything that could draw as large, young and affluent an audience. But for one night at least, that will be a distant thought. Wednesday night will be given to entertainment and the bragging rights of those who will be able to claim they saw it firsthand."

        "The rapper Ice Cube makes his directorial debut with \"The Players Club,\" a hearty throwback to the formula behind '70s blaxploitation films: sex, violence, cash, trash and flash. Set in what is euphemistically called \"a gentleman's club,\" it constructs a 100 percent predictable soap opera around {{Diana Armstrong}}, who is a college student and single mom. \"All this dancin', and finals was just around the corner!\" {{Diana Armstrong}} complains, articulating the film's central dilemma: {{Diana Armstrong}} is wholesome and nice, but {{Diana Armstrong}} has to strut {{Diana Armstrong}} stuff at the club for fiscal reasons. {{Diana Armstrong}} uses {{Diamond}}. In a film that sees {{Diamond}} biggest moral distinction between dancing at the club and moonlighting at bachelor parties, song titles on the soundtrack include \"Shake Watcha Mama Gave Ya,\" \"Show Me da Money,\" \"Whores in the House,\" \"We Be Clubbin\"' and \"You Know {{Diamond}}'m a Ho.\" And yet for all its leering this is as soapy a film as \"Soul Food,\" defending the empowering benefits of exotic dancing yet worrying about good girls gone wrong. In a spirit of exploitation that invokes the heyday of Pam Grier, it also manages to turn {{Diamond}} into a pistol-packin' mama and work in a catfight or two. Ice Cube, who plays a minor heavy and flaunts his trademark scowl, also throws in some broad humor, as when {{Diamond}} nemesis (Chrystale Wilson) shows up at a bachelor party full of white policemen and starts spanking them in honor of Rodney King. Campy moments and a luridly colorful look (with cinematography by Malik Sayeed) may give this no-flair, no-frills B movie a healthy video afterlife some day. There's something to be said for a cautionary tale in which one chastened ex-stripper winds up selling shoes. PRODUCTION NOTES: 'THE PLAYERS CLUB' Written and directed by Ice Cube ; {{Malik Sayeed}}, {{Malik Sayeed}}nema. Running time: 103 minutes. This film is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes much profanity, partial nudity and suggestive situations.

        "{{Charles Johnson}}, whose last novel, \"Middle Passage\" was a historical reconstruction of slavery, has turned to more recent history in \"Dreamer,\" an imagined account of the last days of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They are days filled with evil premonitions of the tragedy that was to strike when {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., 30 years ago. The story shifts from {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} interior monologues to the reflections of {{Charles Johnson}}, {{Charles Johnson}} named {{Matthew Bishop}}. {{Matthew Bishop}} is {{Matthew Bishop}}; indeed, one suspects that {{Matthew Bishop}} is modeled on {{Charles Johnson}}. But {{Charles Johnson}} narrative is aimed principally at {{Chaym Smith}} after redemption who bears an uncanny physical resemblance to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}. As a result, {{Chaym Smith}} earns a role as {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} at a time when {{Chaym Smith}} life was clearly in danger. But {{Chaym Smith}} presence gives {{Charles Johnson}} novel the ambiguous, Conradian eeriness of all stories about the doppelganger, the double, the mirror image and the opposite, the reminder of the invisible person who lies behind the mask. These themes are rich, and they are developed by {{Charles Johnson}} with {{Charles Johnson}} usual stylishness. {{Chaym Smith}} has lived {{Chaym Smith}} life shadowed by {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} fame and {{Chaym Smith}} status as a kind of living saint. In {{Charles Johnson}}, {{Charles Johnson}} experience has made {{Charles Johnson}} both jealous and driven, admiring and vengeful. {{Charles Johnson}} reminds us that {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, and \"Dreamer\" is full of theological reflections. The biblical story of {{Cain}}, whose sacrifice was rather inexplicably rejected by God, resounds through the novel as {{Chaym Smith}} asks why {{Chaym Smith}} has been cursed even as blessings pour down on {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}. \"That was {{Chaym Smith}} stuff,\" {{Chaym Smith}} tells {{Matthew Bishop}} after the two of them have listened to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} speak at a church. \"Not things {{Chaym Smith}}'ve ever said, but stuff {{Chaym Smith}}'ve felt. Like {{Chaym Smith}} spirit is trapped in {{Matthew Bishop}}, which is so much clearer and bigger and cleaner.\" In other words, there are numerous folds to {{Charles Johnson}} psychological intrigue. {{Chaym Smith}} is {{Chaym Smith}}, eloquently irascible, morally deep. And yet \"Dreamer\" is not a complete success, despite the consistently high quality of {{Charles Johnson}} writing. In the end especially, {{Charles Johnson}} seems to lose control of {{Charles Johnson}} doppelganger theme. Instead, \"Dreamer\" turns to a muddled theme of betrayal involving an unlikely pair of federal agents and {{Chaym Smith}}. The betrayal seems, at least by virtue of its timing, linked to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} assassination, though this is far from clear. It is as though {{Charles Johnson}} did not know quite what to do with the forces {{Charles Johnson}} has set into motion. {{Charles Johnson}} recourse to a kind of unresolved and implausible mystery leaves the reader with a sense of incompleteness, anticlimax. And while that might be an intentional reflection of the deeper incompleteness of real life, a lesson in the unresolvability of things does not seem to have been {{Charles Johnson}} purpose. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> The action of \"Dreamers\" takes place mostly in Chicago, where {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, having achieved major victories in the South, has arrived to campaign against Northern forms of racial discrimination. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} is tired and tearful and assailed by doubts. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} wonders in particular if {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} has overestimated the spiritual capacity of blacks and whites alike, whether they are capable of understanding {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} \"deeper, esoteric message about freedom,\" namely that \"to gain the dizzying heights of the mountaintop, {{Charles Johnson}} baggage had to be abandoned in the valley.\" {{Chaym Smith}} arrives at {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} door in the midst of these ruminations. \"{{Chaym Smith}} was the kind of Negro the movement had for years kept away from the world's cameras,\" {{Matthew Bishop}} says of {{Chaym Smith}} appearance: \"sullen, ill-kept, the very embodiment of the blues.\" {{Chaym Smith}} volunteers to be {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} has been unhappily playing most of {{Chaym Smith}} life anyway. When {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} refuses, {{Chaym Smith}} tells {{Chaym Smith}}, \"{{Martin Luther King Jr.}} figure if {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}'m catchin' hell 'cause of {{Matthew Bishop}}, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} might's well catch it for {{Matthew Bishop}} instead.\" {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} agrees to arrange training for {{Chaym Smith}} so {{Chaym Smith}} can be part of the movement, and {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} assigns {{Matthew Bishop}}, the unreciprocating object of {{Matthew Bishop}} desire, to take care of {{Matthew Bishop}}. The story unfolds against a background of increasing urban violence and challenges to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} from younger, more militant blacks within the ranks. \"Dreamer\" in this sense takes on a time-capsule flavor. This is sometimes contrived, for example, when {{Matthew Bishop}} find {{Matthew Bishop}} berated as \"house niggers\" by an ex-con named Yahya Zubena who has found poetry and black power in prison. But the main character remains {{Chaym Smith}}, whose homophonic resemblance to {{Cain}} is made explicit as {{Charles Johnson}} returns again and again to {{Charles Johnson}} biblical theme. \"{{Matthew Bishop}} began to see _ as if a veil had lifted _ the tortured shadow of {{Cain}} everywhere, within {{Matthew Bishop}} and without, {{Cain}} many cultural reincarnations parading through {{Matthew Bishop}} mind like frames projected on a cyclorama,\" {{Matthew Bishop}} tells us. \"It was said that Western man {{Cain}} was {{Cain}}, cursed with the burden of restlessness and the endless quest for selfhood. Down through the centuries, {{Cain}} name was spelled differently in different times. Caym, Kaym, even {{Chaym Smith}}, were etymological variations on it.\" So {{Chaym Smith}}, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, is {{Cain}}, but {{Chaym Smith}} is {{Chaym Smith}}. Near the end, {{Chaym Smith}}, asked by a pair of rather woodenly constructed FBI men to turn from double to double agent, disappears. Soon after, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} is assassinated. {{Charles Johnson}} seems to be saying something about the collective failure to climb to the mountaintop as well as collective responsibility for {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} death. That is no doubt true, but it is also a nostrum, a commonplace sort of wisdom. And it is unmoored from the deeply personal and individual mystery that {{Chaym Smith}} presented at the outset.

        "NEW YORK _ When the Metropolitan Opera first presented the {{Otto Schenk}} production of {{Wagner}} in 1993, {{Otto Schenk}} work, though conservative, was evocative and colorful, and {{James Levine}} conducting was spacious and nuanced. When the production was brought back two seasons ago, the production was even more humane, and {{James Levine}} conducting more luminous. \"Die Meistersinger\" returned on Monday night. The original reason for bringing it back was that {{James Morris}} was planning to sing {{Hans Sachs}} first {{Hans Sachs}}, one of opera's longest roles, {{Wagner}} wise shoemaker, a widower in medieval {{Nurnberg}} and the most beloved member of the town's guild of master singers. But {{James Morris}} withdrew last fall, and the Met had to come up fast with a replacement. In {{James Johnson}}, an American bass making {{James Johnson}} house debut, the company had {{Hans Sachs}}. Moreover, {{James Levine}} intricate and organic work seemed even deeper this time around. The orchestra playing on Monday positively glowed. Yet onstage there was a sense of a production thrown together and lacking inspiration, and the likely cause was the jokey and intrusively busy stage direction of {{David McClintock}}. \"Die Meistersinger\" is a comedy, but a tender, insightful and, at times, troubling comedy, not the antic fest it sometimes seemed here. Take, for example, the depiction of Beckmesser, the town clerk. Beckmesser may be laughable, but he must be endearingly laughable. His dream of marrying {{Eva Johansson}}, {{Eva Johansson}}, by winning the guild's annual song contest, and his scheming to outmaneuver {{Hans Sachs}} show {{Hans Sachs}} to be hapless, not nasty or stupid. {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}}, {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}}, sang the role splendidly but was not helped by the stage direction. When {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} nighttime serenade to {{Eva Johansson}} is mischievously interrupted by {{Hans Sachs}} cobbling, a pouting Beckmesser struts about the street in circles, {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} hands linked behind {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} back, a cartoonish and cliched idea. The aches and pains {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} suffers from the town brawl set off by {{Hans-Joachim Ketelsen}} serenading were inanely overacted. Aside from the directorial slips, there were some vocal rewards, especially from the musicianly tenor Ben Heppner, who had a triumphant evening reprising the daunting role of the young knight Walther. His voice sounded rested, free and thrilling. {{James Johnson}} has a sturdy though not exceptional voice, and stamina. {{James Johnson}} could have projected more of {{Hans Sachs}} had {{Hans Sachs}} not been directed to act like a bully, shoving Beckmesser around at will, and flinging Eva at Walther (three times!), {{Hans Sachs}} the fatherly {{Hans Sachs}} would never do. {{Eva Johansson}}, {{Eva Johansson}}, made a lovely {{Eva Johansson}}, but the girlishness of {{Eva Johansson}} characterization was too aggressively projected, and at full volume her voice tended to turn harsh and wobbly. The Danish tenor Gert Henning-Jensen made his debut as {{Hans Sachs}} apprentice, {{David McClintock}}, and with his boyish looks and balletic agility he looked the part. But his voice was hard pressed in places. Wendy White was sympathetic as Magdalene, and {{Hans Sotin}} was {{Hans Sotin}}. The amassed sound of the Met chorus greeting Sachs in the final scene will not be easily forgotten. If only the antics of the stage direction could be cleaned up. It almost makes you long for Robert Wilson's glacial staging of \"Lohengrin.\""

        "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, they are working on a project they call \"the last book.\" This may sound ominous to book lovers. After all, the Media Lab devotes itself mainly to computers. Looking at a computer means reading an electronic screen, which is decidedly not the way most people want to read a book, particularly the last one. Reading text on a computer screen is confining and tiresome. You can't see where you are or how far you have to go. You can't leaf through the pages to compare parts of the text or to see what your eye finds at random. You can't comfortably carry a computer screen around with you, to bed, to the beach or to the bathroom. You can't collect computer screens, or bind them beautifully in vellum, or display them on shelves in the spirit that the English novelist Anthony Powell evoked when he titled one of his volumes \"Books Do Furnish a Room.\" But hold everything! The news is far from grim. The book of the future described to me on a visit to the Media Lab is really a book, just like \"Goodnight Moon,\" \"Paradise Lost\" or the Gutenberg Bible. It has a binding that could be made of leather if you wanted, and hundreds of pages you can turn one at a time or riffle through. You'll be able to carry it around with you, to bed, to the beach or to the bathroom. The key to this book is something called electronic ink, or e-ink, which can be applied to the page from within instead of by a press. Being developed by {{Joseph Jacobson}}, {{Joseph Jacobson}} at MIT, with the backing of Things That Think and News in the Future, two business consortia of some 75 companies, this e-ink consists of microscopic spheres, each about 40 microns in diameter, or about half the thickness of a piece of paper. Each sphere is half black and half white. These spheres can be applied by the millions to paper and then flipped over electronically to either their black sides or their white sides to produce what looks like a traditional printed page. As envisioned at the Media Lab, the book pages will each have fine wires carrying electricity to flip the dots in the direction of a computer concealed in the book binding. The user will scroll through a list of book titles displayed on the book's spine. If the user selects \"Ulysses,\" the computer will make the text appear on the book's pages by flipping the appropriate spheres to their black or white sides. As the capacity of the book's memory grows, whole libraries may be installed. {{Joseph Jacobson}} foresees being able to store the entire U.S. Library of Congress, whose holdings number more than 17 million volumes. A user might also be able to assemble a book from multiple sources to fit special needs. Illustrations might be animated. E-ink could also make it possible to receive broadcasts that typeset themselves to create instant newspaper. Yet the book would still have the familiar advantages of a book, {{Joseph Jacobson}} says. You could unplug its power and carry it anywhere. The display would be designed to sense the presence of a stylus, or pen, so that you could underline or write notes on it. You might even be able to dogear the book. {{Joseph Jacobson}} greatly admires the traditional book. \"After all,\" {{Joseph Jacobson}} added, \"if books had been invented after the computer, they would have been considered a big breakthrough. Books have several hundred simultaneous paper-thin, flexible displays. They boot instantly. They run on very low power at a very low cost.\" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Every book ever published in a single volume? The mind boggles and a dozen questions form. Will this really happen? How soon could the last book be available? \"A prototype with just a few pages could be put together in two to three years, with one of 400 pages taking a year or two longer,\" {{Joseph Jacobson}} said. (It should be pointed out that two years ago, in a description of {{Joseph Jacobson}} project published by the Media Lab, {{Joseph Jacobson}} stated that a prototype would be available in \"about two years,\" meaning 1998. What I actually saw at the Media Lab did not approach even one page.) \"We have already demonstrated the fundamental new parts needed to make it,\" {{Joseph Jacobson}} continued. \"Since there are many different projects that can be enabled by this underpinning technology, exactly when it will be combined to form a book is not yet clear. But an important point is that these are technologies that are easily manufactured and not phenomenally expensive.\" How much will it cost then? {{Joseph Jacobson}} says the volume will probably retail for $2 to $4 per reusable page, or $500 to $1,000 for a book that is every book, although {{Joseph Jacobson}} is working on ways to reduce costs even further. \"It would be nice to have a cost so low that you could lose the book without worrying about it too much,\" {{Joseph Jacobson}} added. \"{{Joseph Jacobson}} believe that will be possible.\" What about the cost of the contents? Books in the public domain could be downloaded for nothing, {{Joseph Jacobson}} says. For new works and books still in copyright, a system of royalties could be set up in which texts would be encrypted and readers would buy the access code by Internet, phone or wireless transaction. Some questions remain unanswered. What are the implications for the publishing industry? Already any writer can post a book on the Internet. But books will still need to be edited and promoted. What about libraries? Bookstores? Remainders? Used books? First editions? Rare books? Copies inscribed by the author? Autographing parties? What, in heaven's name, is to become of the dearly beloved book borrower? Will books no longer furnish a room? It looks as if they won't, unless, like me, you will still insist on having certain titles on the shelf, to remind you of their existence and your promise to yourself to read them some day. The likes of us will have to keep on collecting old-fashioned books. Or maybe resort to displaying those Potemkin villages of books on our shelves, rows and rows of our favorite titles in colors that match the furniture and the pets. Just one of them will be real and removable from the shelf. It will contain not hollowed-out pages with a gun or a whisky flask or cash or diamonds, but a treasure far greater: at the touch of a button, any book ever written. And when it is removed, family members will be free to ask a question that might once have reflected a certain benightedness: \"Hey!\" they'll be able to cry out. \"Who's using the book?\""

        "Radar estimates of rainfall over eastern Nebraska and southern Iowa exceeded 5 inches on Tuesday as an intense low-pressure system stalled over the middle Mississippi Valley. This disturbance will slowly move east Wednesday as a new center of low pressure forms farther to the south in western Tennessee. Rain will taper off across the Middle West, but drizzle and low clouds will persist in the central and northern Plains. A wedge of cool air will occupy the Northeast as clouds and light showers move into southern New England ahead of a warm front. Developing onshore winds will keep the North Atlantic Coast cooler than seasonal levels. Some sunshine along with breezes from the southwest will bring very mild air to the Middle Atlantic region. Thunderstorms will form into a cluster over the interior Southeast as a jet stream disturbance interacts with very humid air moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico. Hail and damaging straight-line winds are possible with a few of the storms. A cold front pushing eastward across the lower Mississippi Valley will be followed by sunny and pleasantly warm weather in the southern Plains. Cool, moist air will cover most of the Rockies and Pacific States as jet stream disturbances move steadily east from the North Pacific. Snow levels will decrease a few hundred feet in the Cascades. Patches of rain will dampen northern California and western Oregon as low pressure moves slowly inland. The Southwest will be sunny and a bit warmer, but clouds will arrive later in the day. Focus: Capital Snow A tenth of an inch of snow fell at Ronald Reagan Washington International Airport on Dec. 9, 1997, the first and last time it snowed in our nation's capital this season. The modicum of snow matched the mark set in the 1972 - 1973, which had held the exclusive title as the least snowiest winter of record. Curiously, there were 16 days with a trace of snow this season, compared to 12 days with a trace of snow in 1972 - 73. The chances of a late spring snow in Washington are slim. After April 15, there has been only one occurrence of measurable snow since weather records began in 1887."

        "The Smithsonian Institution in Washington has shut down three divisions producing books, records, and videos, most notably the Smithsonian Collection of Recordings, which has issued widely praised albums of jazz and popular music. Officials said on Tuesday that they hoped to continue offering some of the recordings but the announcement of the cutbacks, particularly of the recordings, were met with widespread alarm and disappointment by scholars and collectors. In a memo dated March 31, Smithsonian undersecretary Constance Berry Newman announced the closing of the three divisions and the loss of 10 jobs at the institution, which has 6,500 employees overall. The memo's contents were reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. Most significant was the closing of the Smithsonian Collection of Recordings, which has been an invaluable resource for scholars and the public for a quarter-century. Best known for recordings like the \"Collection of Classic Jazz,\" which has sold more than a million copies since 1973, the Smithsonian recordings have received two Grammy awards and been nominated for 11 others. \"{{Dan Morgenstern}} think it's unwise, and it surprised {{Dan Morgenstern}} quite a bit,\" {{Dan Morgenstern}}, {{Dan Morgenstern}}, said of the decision. \"They had a certain cachet, and did some very good things. {{Dan Morgenstern}} can't believe the Smithsonian, which is the closest thing we have in this country to a national museum, is so poverty stricken they can't keep this going.\" But officials at the Smithsonian said the closing of the recording division reflected problems with its distribution system, which relies largely on direct mail, more than discontent with its mission. They said they hoped to offer some recordings in the future if the operation could be made economically feasible. \"What we eliminated was the current method for distributing these recordings,\" said Robert Schelin, acting managing director of Smithsonian Press/Smithsonian Productions, which oversees the three divisions that were cut. \"The curators and historians will still be in place. What we're really re-evaluating is the mechanisms for producing and distributing this kind of work.\" Also closed were Smithsonian Books, which specialized in a small number of mass-market books sold through direct mail, and a small video production division. The decision leaves intact the Smithsonian Institution Press, the main book publishing arm of the museum. Smithsonian Books, which was closed, had 15 titles, mostly glossy illustrated books. Smithsonian Institution Press has 800 scholarly and general interest titles, which are primarily sold at bookstores and museums rather than through direct mail. All three of the divisions that are closing are part of Smithsonian Press/Smithsonian Productions, which has lost $10.8 million over the last two years and is expecting a $2-million loss this year, officials said. The total Smithsonian budget is $552 million. The move does not entirely end the Smithsonian's role in the recording industry. Folkways Recordings, which has distributed folk and archival recordings for more than a decade as part of the Smithsonian, remains. Officials left open the possibility that the jazz, country and pop recordings done by the Smithsonian Collection of Recordings could continue, perhaps under the imprint of the Folkways label. In her memo, Ms. Newman said an analysis would continue of the continuing operations to \"explore ways in which the dissemination of scholarly works through a recordings and a production program can continue in some form.\" A Smithsonian Institution spokesman, Linda St. Thomas said on Tuesday that the Smithsonian would like to find a way to continue some of the recording functions, but that it was too early to tell in what form and to what degree that might play out. Officials said the decisions were made against the backdrop both of the financial needs of the Smithsonian and the changes in the marketplace that have buffeted many direct-mail operations. \"{{Peter Cannell}} understanding is that as the direct-mail environment has eroded overall for all businesses, those projects became more and more difficult to sustain,\" said {{Peter Cannell}}, {{Peter Cannell}}, the surviving publishing arm. {{Peter Cannell}} said employees at the Smithsonian viewed the cutbacks with conflicting feelings. \"It's a decision that is in some ways sorry to see,\" {{Peter Cannell}} said. \"But on the other hand, any business or institution has to be able to change with the times, and that's what we're doing here.\""

        "BELFAST, {{Tony Blair}} flew into Northern Ireland on Tuesday in an urgent effort to remove a serious snag in the peace negotiations between Protestant and Roman Catholic political leaders in this mostly Protestant British province. \"{{Tony Blair}} feel the hand of history upon our shoulders,\" {{Tony Blair}} said on arriving at Hillsborough, a government residence south of Belfast, for a meeting with {{David Trimble}}, {{David Trimble}}. \"It's right to try,\" {{Tony Blair}} said. \"{{Tony Blair}}'m here to try.\" Although {{Tony Blair}} office insisted that {{Tony Blair}} had been scheduled to arrive in Belfast on Tuesday, it was believed here that {{Tony Blair}} arrival had been moved up from Wednesday in response to the potential new crisis. {{David Trimble}} said a set of proposals given to the negotiating parties early Tuesday was unacceptable, a rejection that was widely seen as a melodramatic tactic to take the initiative in peace talks. But the tactic could backfire and push the talks to the brink of a collapse, which would probably turn the melodrama into the tragedy of widespread violence by the main Catholic and Protestant guerrilla groups, which are now observing cease-fires. Sectarian violence has killed more than 3,200 people in the North since 1969. The deadline for an agreement intended to end 800 years of sectarian violence in Ireland has been set for midnight Thursday. And former U.S. Sen. {{George Mitchell}}, D- Maine, the chairman of the talks, said Tuesday morning that the deadline would not be extended and that {{George Mitchell}} job was virtually over after nearly two years. The prime minister arrived hours after the latest, and most serious, obstacle to agreement was advanced by {{David Trimble}}, {{David Trimble}}. {{David Trimble}} said {{George Mitchell}} and have not been made public, were biased in favor of the two Catholic parties, the mainstream Social Democratic Labor and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. {{Tony Blair}} sought to reassure Protestants by noting that it was British and Irish policy that there will be no united Ireland _ the ultimate goal of the IRA _ unless it is approved by a majority. The Northern Ireland majority is likely to remain Protestant well into the next century. Once {{David Trimble}} makes {{David Trimble}} own proposals in the next two days, the predictable reaction would be rejection by Sinn Fein and possibly the Social Democrats and a rush of last-ditch negotiations to get a compromise agreement by midnight Thursday. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> The Catholics would seek support from the Irish Republic's Prime Minister {{Bertie Ahern}}, while Protestants look to {{Tony Blair}} to argue for them. The Catholics want an agreement that would increase their political power in a new elected lawmaking assembly that would be part of the drastic changes in Northern Ireland's political structure that is envisioned in {{George Mitchell}}. They also want a new cross-border North-South Council, with ministers from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, that would be authorized to make binding decisions in the North's affairs. Now, the Irish Republic has only a marginal consultative role. Protestants bristle at these demands, seeing them as a way for the Catholics to create a united Ireland, free of British control and run from Dublin. {{George Mitchell}} are known to cover these new government bodies. Protestants want weaker bodies that would be controlled by the Protestant majority that would elected to the new assembly. In a telephone call to {{Tony Blair}} London office, {{David Trimble}} said, {{Tony Blair}} said of {{George Mitchell}}, \"Before contemplating alternate proposals, {{David Trimble}} wish to know from {{Tony Blair}} and the Irish government if {{Tony Blair}} are prepared to consider radically different measures.\" The principal Protestant complaint with the Irish government, a sponsor of the talks with Britain, is that the Irish have refused to specify how they would tone down Ireland's constitutional claim to sovereignty in the North. {{Bertie Ahern}}, who was in Dublin on Tuesday for {{Bertie Ahern}} mother's funeral, did not immediately comment on {{David Trimble}}. {{David Trimble}} was partly motivated by {{David Trimble}} need to stave off the vehement criticism by the Rev. {{Ian Paisley}}, who has kept {{Ian Paisley}} Democratic Unionist Party out of the talks. As {{David Trimble}} was stating {{David Trimble}}, {{Ian Paisley}} was haranguing {{David Trimble}} in television interviews as a traitor who was selling out to Catholic terrorists. {{David Trimble}} and {{Ian Paisley}} compete for Protestant votes in general elections. In a new northern assembly, {{David Trimble}} would be {{David Trimble}}. \"{{David Trimble}} can't negotiate by stunts,\" said {{Seamus Mallon}}, {{Seamus Mallon}}. \"This is no stunt,\" said Jeffrey Donaldson, one of Trimble's Unionist Party allies. \"This is for real.\""

        "NEW YORK _ The prices of Treasury securities were slightly lower on Tuesday in quiet trading, as some investors sold Treasuries to make room for new supplies from issuers like the South Korean government and Federal Loan Home Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond declined 9/32 to a price of 104, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.84 percent, from 5.82 percent on Monday. In its first international bond sale, Korea began selling $3 billion of global bonds in a move that could have wide implications for the country's financial institutions and corporations hoping to tap the global debt market. The sale could also serve as an indicator of investors' appetite for the debt of other Asian nations hurt by the region's financial crisis. In the first of two parts, the government is selling $1 billion in five-year notes with an estimated yield of about 8.99 percent, or 350 basis points more than a comparable Treasury, and $2 billion of 10-year notes at an estimated 9.14 percent, or 362.5 basis points over Treasury. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. Though the actual pricing will not occur until Wednesday, market participants said there was strong demand for the bonds. Meanwhile, in another big sale, Freddie Mac priced $5 billion of a 10-year note through underwriters Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Salomon Smith Barney, at a price to yield 5.849 percent. Like the South Korean issue, it appears to have been a success. The offering comes just one week after a $4-billion sale by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae. With yields on Treasury securities at low levels, strong demand for these corporate and global issues came as no surprise. Such issues are attractive to those who do not expect further large gains in U.S. government securities without further proof that the economy is slowing enough to keep inflation contained. In the Treasury market, traders said they expected continued sluggishness for the next few days, as the market may have risen too much last week. The Treasury itself was an active buyer Tuesday, purchasing $1.4 billion of coupon issues with maturities from April 1998 to March 1999, lending some support to prices. {{Bill Gamba}}, senior vice president and manager of bond trading at Cowen &AMP; Co., was struck by the low volume. \"If the market were trading on Saturday and Sunday {{Bill Gamba}} couldn't imagine it being slower than this,\" {{Bill Gamba}} said. \"There were many players absent.\" Because the bond market will be closed for half of the session on Thursday and then closed for Good Friday, many players have already given up for the week. {{Bill Gamba}} said {{Bill Gamba}} did not expect that the Treasury's $8-billion auction on Wednesday of 30-year inflation-indexed bonds would hold any surprises for the market."

        "I used to love the sound of the penny whistle. It's a well-nigh perfect instrument: portable, cheap, and low-tech, with no moving parts. It's easy to play yet capable of great subtlety; a skillful player can make notes bend and quiver and sigh. And it immediately invokes a long and precious tradition. The penny whistle and tin whistle, with or without a mouthpiece, provide one of the primal sounds of Celtic music, plaintive in slow airs and dizzyingly nimble in dance tunes. When a musician pulls a whistle out of a pocket and joins in a melody, it's a surviving link to centuries of homemade music. But now it is my regretful duty to propose a ban on penny whistle use anywhere outside a Guinness -pulling pub, effective immediately. A sweet sound is on the verge of curdling, and it is time to save it from overexposure. There won't be any immediate hardship. St. Patrick's Day is well behind us, and \"My Heart Will Go On,\" the whistle-topped hit from the \"Titanic\" soundtrack, has been duly presented with its Oscar (and can look forward to a Grammy next year). The \"Titanic\" album is berthed at No. 1, with {{Celine Dion}} at No. 2. When I heard a tin whistle tootling through a blues, \"Broken Hearted,\" on {{Eric Clapton}} new album, \"Pilgrim,\" it suddenly became clear: the whistle is becoming the trendy sonic accessory of the late 1990s. This happens to instruments, and it's not a pretty process. It happened to the sitar (and then the electric sitar), to the Cajun accordion and to panpipes. They are all now tainted by their abuse at the hands of everyone from hippie bands to horror movie auteurs. Rousted from their ethnic enclaves, the instruments' masters revel in their new-found prominence. Then, too late, they realize that they're only the flavor of the moment, and the moment never lasts. At first the new sound is a novelty, an ear-catching break from the usual guitars and keyboards; it leaps out of a radio speaker. Then, in a matter of years or months, it's everywhere: first the imitative bands, then the soundtracks and commercials, in a process that keeps speeding up. As soon as they can retool, keyboard manufacturers begin to include a pre-set simulation of the sound, so that the local Top 40 band can start inserting it into songs. By then, the sound is forever associated with its pop moment, the way reverbed guitar spells early- 1960s surf music or staccato synthesizers hark back to new-wave rock, circa 1979. For years, the whistle hovered under the pop radar. When {{Van Morrison}} sang with the whistle-toting Chieftains in 1988, {{Van Morrison}} was simply claiming {{Van Morrison}} Irish heritage. When {{Paul Simon}} put a whistle solo in the middle of \"You Can Call Me Al\" on \"Graceland\" in 1986, {{Paul Simon}} was paying direct homage to South African kwela music, another penny whistle stronghold. But there was no rush to latch on to the sound. For nearly a decade, the whistle tootled on in easy obscurity. Then along came the corporate Celtic blockbusters of the late 1990s, \"Riverdance\" and \"Lord of the Dance,\" with a whistle skirling while ranks of vigorous step-dancers clattered away in formation, something like an Irish \"Triumph of the Will.\" Simultaneously, in quieter realms, New Age music latched on to Celtic music for its soothing, timeless drones and the gentle but piquant tones of the traditional instruments. As ethnicity was being rediscovered worldwide, the Celts were well prepared. {{James Horner}} uses elements of both \"Riverdance\" muscle and New Age sweetness to lend a Celtic veneer to its sweeping Romantic crescendos. (Perhaps the Celtic connection is that the Titanic was built in Belfast.) And as the movie and {{James Horner}} became omnipresent, the innocent whistle turned into something else. It has moved from the unassuming context of a ceilidh, an Irish jam session, to sail above an orchestra and to parley with {{Celine Dion}} ; it has become an implement of coercive tear-jerking. No doubt other arrangers, even now, are planning to use it the same way. TOO GOOD A SOUND TO LOSE, ULTIMATELY Banned or not, the whistle will have its time, then recede. That {{Eric Clapton}} song, five years hence, will immediately signal \"1998\" the way an electric sitar moans \"late 1960s.\" Of course, the whistle won't disappear from traditional Irish groups, and the thriving subgenre of Celtic New Age music isn't likely to rule it out either. It's too good a sound to lose. In the broader pop arena, meanwhile, the whistle will fade out of earshot, probably soon after it turns up in a commercial for some deeply inappropriate product. Producers will move on to the next instrument: the elemental honk of the didgeridoo, perhaps, or the mellow peal of the Indonesian trompong, a set of tuned gongs. And then, in 15 to 20 years, some sample-happy producer will get the bright idea of placing the clear, airy tone of the whistle into a mix. Someone else will notice it and add it to another track, and it will spread the way 1970s wah-wah blaxploitation guitars are showing up all over the place. Some people will remember the \"Titanic\" boom as simple nostalgia or forgiven kitsch. Certain children will note their parents growing all misty-eyed and laugh or join them with a tinge of self-consciousness. Hearing the sound of breath through tin, they will imagine not the green fields of Ireland, but the whistle's days in the big time, amplified and ubiquitous, when a humble instrument was touched by destiny."

        "NEW YORK _ {{Werner Herzog}} tells a real-life tall tale in \"Little Dieter Needs To Fly,\" a documentary that describes enough breakneck adventures for any action hero. But the swashbuckler who is the film's subject, {{Dieter Dengler}}, mostly describes his exploits from memory. Now a garrulous extrovert living a comfortable life near San Francisco, he talks of extraordinary early hardship and of the drive that sustained him. With a German childhood seared by images of World War II, and with an American military career that saw him shot down over Laos in 1966, he has many a hair-raising story to tell. But as often happens in {{Werner Herzog}} haunting documentaries, the most interesting figure seems to be the one behind the camera. Though {{Dieter Dengler}} is a practiced raconteur and has {{Dieter Dengler}} story amply illustrated here, it is {{Werner Herzog}} occasional meditations on {{Dieter Dengler}} subject that linger. \"As a child,\" the filmmaker says in voice-over, \"{{Dieter Dengler}} saw things that made no earthly sense at all. Germany had been transformed into a dreamscape of the surreal.\" Starkly poetic images of wartime destruction accompany that observation. Aerial shots of voluptuous explosions in the jungle amplify {{Werner Herzog}} idea of what it must have been like for {{Dieter Dengler}} to be a fighter pilot: \"It all looked strange, like a barbaric dream.\" \"Little Dieter Needs to Fly,\" which opens on Wednesday at the Film Forum, is one of the filmmaker's least exotic works, but it straightforwardly presents {{Dieter Dengler}} eventful history. {{Dieter Dengler}} speaks of having, as a boy, torn wallpaper off bombed-out walls so that {{Dieter Dengler}} mother could cook it, since there were nutrients in the glue. {{Dieter Dengler}} shows the camera how, even now, memories of being in a prisoner-of-war camp lead {{Dieter Dengler}} to keep hundreds of pounds of emergency provisions hidden under {{Dieter Dengler}} house, just in case. Returning to Southeast Asia with a camera crew ({{Werner Herzog}} enlists villagers and water buffalo to stand impassively before the camera and provide atmosphere), {{Dieter Dengler}} describes {{Werner Herzog}} harrowing experiences as a prisoner. \"They were just always thinking of something to do to {{Werner Herzog}},\" {{Werner Herzog}} says of {{Werner Herzog}} captors, from whom {{Werner Herzog}} ultimately made a highly dramatic escape. {{Dieter Dengler}} illustrates how to open handcuffs with a piece of wire, tells of biting a snake in two, even shares a black-tie reunion dinner with the helicopter pilot who finally rescued {{Dieter Dengler}}. And in light of {{Dieter Dengler}} many ordeals, {{Dieter Dengler}} pleasant chattiness begins to seem the film's strangest aspect. As {{Werner Herzog}} puts it: \"{{Werner Herzog}} hides behind the casual remark that this was the fun part of {{Werner Herzog}} life.\" PRODUCTION NOTES: 'LITTLE DIETER NEEDS TO FLY' Produced and directed by Werner Herzog ; director of photography, Peter Zeitlinger ; edited by Rainer Standke, Glen Scantlebury, and Joe Bini ; released by Werner Herzog Filmproduktion. At the Film Forum, 209 West Houston St. Running time: 80 minutes. This film is not rated. With: Werner Herzog (Narrator) and Dieter Dengler (himself)."

        "MOSCOW _ In a meeting that was as much political theater as substance, {{Boris Yeltsin}} summoned {{Boris Yeltsin}} opponents to the Kremlin Tuesday in an attempt to show that {{Boris Yeltsin}} has a steady grip on the reins of power and to drum up support for {{Boris Yeltsin}} new prime minister. The much ballyhooed political round table took place in the ornate St. Catherine Hall. The president held center stage while {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}, {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}, sat by {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} side. The television cameras captured {{Boris Yeltsin}} as {{Boris Yeltsin}} served notice to {{Boris Yeltsin}} critics that {{Boris Yeltsin}} had no intention of abandoning {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. After projecting an image of strength, {{Boris Yeltsin}} portrayed {{Boris Yeltsin}} as a reasonable leader who would try to work with the Communist -dominated lower house of parliament. But the meeting itself was something less than definitive. After the two-hour session ended, the back-room negotiating over the {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} nomination went on. \"{{Yevgeny Volk}} think it was a purely cosmetic event,\" said {{Yevgeny Volk}}. \"What we are talking about is bargaining. In tactical terms, {{Boris Yeltsin}} conducted a round table so that the Communists and nationals could say their pressure on the government had been answered.\" {{Yevgeny Volk}}, however, expressed the dominant view in Moscow that {{Boris Yeltsin}} would ultimately succeed in winning parliamentary approval of {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. Indeed, the key question increasingly appears to be not whether {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} will be approved but what the cost will be in terms of symbolic or substantive concessions by Yeltsin in new appointments or programs. To be sure, {{Boris Yeltsin}} was not the only one striking poses. {{Gennadi Zyuganov}}, {{Gennadi Zyuganov}}, declared after the meeting that the Communists would not back {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} when his nomination comes before Parliament on Friday. But that does not mean that the Communists are determined to block the nomination indefinitely. Many political analysts believe that the Communists are determined to appear resolute before a national day of protest scheduled for Thursday. And {{Gennadi Zyuganov}} was careful not to exclude the possibility that the Communists might eventually acquiesce in the nomination. {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}}, {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}}, said {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}} would back {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} only on the condition that {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}} could pick some of the members of {{Boris Yeltsin}}. {{Alexander Shokhin}}, {{Alexander Shokhin}}, also suggested {{Alexander Shokhin}} party should influence the composition of {{Boris Yeltsin}} new team. {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} was the most adamant in the opposition to {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} appears to be calculating that the influence of {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} Yablocko Party will increase if {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} remains unambiguously in the opposition or if {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} falls by the wayside. The Parliament's first vote on the {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} nomination is expected on Friday. Even if the Parliament rebuffs {{Boris Yeltsin}}, the president has indicated {{Boris Yeltsin}} will press again for the Parliament's approval and {{Boris Yeltsin}} has considerable leverage. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> If the Parliament rejects {{Boris Yeltsin}} choice for prime minister three times, the president can disband the parliament and call for new parliamentary elections. Many parliamentary deputies are loath to compete in such early elections and prefer to hold on their posts and privileges as long as possible. But Tuesday's meeting was designed to avoid a confrontation. During the session, {{Boris Yeltsin}} said {{Boris Yeltsin}} had considered several other choices, including Yegor Stroyev, the head of the upper house of parliament and Moscow major Yuri Luzhkov, before settling on the 35-year -{{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. {{Boris Yeltsin}} praised {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} professionalism and said that {{Boris Yeltsin}} could include candidates from opposing factions. {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} is to propose a list over the next week of officials that would serve in {{Boris Yeltsin}}. {{Boris Yeltsin}} grandly declared that 1998 should be \"a year without confrontation,\" overlooking the fact that {{Boris Yeltsin}} had not bothered to consult the parliament of most of {{Boris Yeltsin}} own government before picking {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} and ordering {{Boris Yeltsin}} surprise government shake-up\" \"{{Boris Yeltsin}} will not veto your decisions and you should abstain from bans,\" {{Boris Yeltsin}} said. \"Let's try to get along this way.\""

        "CHICAGO _ \"{{Eppie Lederer}}'m in the middle of everything,\" said {{Eppie Lederer}}. She was speaking of Chicago, the hometown she loves, but she could have been pinpointing her own spot on the cultural map. As {{Ann Landers}}, {{Eppie Lederer}} has been the arbiter of Main Street American mores since 1955, dishing out advice seven days a week in a column that the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most widely syndicated in the world, with 90 million readers in some 1,200 newspapers. {{Ann Landers}} receives 2,000 letters a day. {{Eppie Lederer}} isn't slowing down as {{Eppie Lederer}} approaches 80 (on the Fourth of July). I'd come to {{Eppie Lederer}} palatial apartment above Lake Michigan to learn how {{Eppie Lederer}} and {{Eppie Lederer}} readers had survived the {{Bill Clinton}} sex scandals. \"{{Eppie Lederer}} have the pulse of the nation, so to speak,\" {{Eppie Lederer}} said. Dressed in red _ and speaking in the firecracker Chicago newsroom rhythms of \"The Front Page\" _ {{Eppie Lederer}} might BE the pulse of the nation. A Democrat, {{Eppie Lederer}} has kept {{Eppie Lederer}} readers' trust by never endorsing politicians _ or products or fads. While {{Ronald Reagan}} and Jimmy Carter appointed {{Eppie Lederer}} to boards and {{Bill Clinton}} invited {{Eppie Lederer}} to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom (\"No money connected _ {{Bill Clinton}} gave {{Ronald Reagan}} nothing!\"), {{Eppie Lederer}} will vouch for the private life of just one of the many presidents {{Eppie Lederer}} has known: \"{{Truman}} is the one {{Eppie Lederer}} would bet on _ that {{Truman}} was absolutely, totally faithful to Bess.\" As for the {{Bill Clinton}} accusations and revelations: \"{{Eppie Lederer}} didn't know what {{Eppie Lederer}}'d get from readers. Would {{Bill Clinton}} be outraged? Would there be a lot of anti- {{Bill Clinton}} stuff? {{Eppie Lederer}} was surprised _ there was so little negative mail and such an outpouring of support. {{Eppie Lederer}} have concluded this is a very popular president. {{Bill Clinton}}'re saying it's not our business, and we don't care... This is not just sophisticated New York and California. This is Middle America. {{Eppie Lederer}} column appears in a lot of small-town papers _ Des Moines ; Muskegon ; Tyler, Texas.\" {{Paula Jones}} \"The readers knew who was prompting {{Paula Jones}}, who gave {{Paula Jones}} the makeover. They don't buy it. {{Eppie Lederer}} say hurray for the American public!\" {{Monica Lewinsky}} \"They feel sorry for {{Monica Lewinsky}}. They feel {{Monica Lewinsky}}'s a little long in the tooth to be chasing celebrities. {{Monica Lewinsky}} isn't a teen-ager.\" {{Kenneth Starr}} \"{{Kenneth Starr}} failed. {{Kenneth Starr}} should go to Pepperdine already.\" {{Linda Tripp}} \"{{Linda Tripp}} is {{Linda Tripp}}, {{Bill Clinton}} tell you. {{Bill Clinton}}'ve had absolutely no positive mail about {{Linda Tripp}}.\" But doesn't the public's refusal to condemn {{Bill Clinton}} signal some kind of moral collapse? {{Eppie Lederer}}, whose own marriage ended in divorce in 1975, said: \"People are much more willing to forgive now. They are more permissive. They are more realistic. This is the way life is. Not all husbands are faithful... {{Eppie Lederer}}'ve been doing this 43 years. The country has been going in this direction for some time. {{Eppie Lederer}} don't think it's just the Clintons. We're getting to be more forgiving as a people. It's a good thing.\" {{Eppie Lederer}} also dismissed the notion that the nation's children had been scarred by the nonstop talk of oral sex and adultery: \"It's awfully hard to shock a kid above 8 years of age in this country unless they're living in a glass bubble. The children know a heck of a lot more than their parents think they do. {{Eppie Lederer}} knew more than {{Eppie Lederer}} parents thought {{Eppie Lederer}} knew.\" {{Eppie Lederer}} attributes today's kids' knowledge about sex to TV. {{Eppie Lederer}} grew up in pre-TV Sioux City, Iowa, but {{Abe Friedman}}, {{Abe Friedman}}, owned theaters, among them a burlesque house. \"That's where my sister\" _ {{Pauline}}, {{Pauline}}, who writes the rival \"Dear Abby\" column _ \"and I got our sex education. We were 15 years old and the girls in the chorus were 16 years old. We hung out backstage because we liked them. We talked to them a lot, and we heard PLENTY.\" In other words, I asked, you don't find the {{Bill Clinton}} scandals particularly momentous? {{Eppie Lederer}} abruptly got up, went to an adjoining room and came back with a big scrapbook. In it were photos of {{Eppie Lederer}} visit with American soldiers in a Saigon hospital in 1967. \"War is what's important,\" {{Eppie Lederer}} said, turning the pages. \"This is what counts _ not this other kind of stuff about {{Linda Tripp}}. Who cares about {{Linda Tripp}}? The American people are pretty solid, they're pretty savvy, and they know what's important. That's why they're not screaming and yelling about {{Bill Clinton}} and some of these females.\" Then {{Eppie Lederer}} put down the scrapbook to offer some advice. \"This,\" {{Eppie Lederer}} said, \"is where you should end your column.\""

        "As a freshman in college some 30 years ago, I was a literature major with a problem: I had a token science requirement to fulfill. The solution? I took a course titled \"Primitive Art.\" It was taught by the anthropology department, and classes were held in the local museum of natural history, where African sculptures were jumbled in with geological specimens and stuffed birds. The status of those sculptures has changed over time. Today, more often than not, they've found a home in art museums. African art as a field of study is listed under art history, and no field of research is more stimulating or innovative. And none carries so heavy a burden of misconceptions. One of these has to do with the identity of African artists. Colonial collectors rarely took note of who carved the spectacular statues and masks they shipped back to Europe. Modern ethnology, with which the study of African art still overlaps, concentrates on social traditions and belief systems rather than things, and seldom has an eye out for authorship. For whatever reason, the idea has long been current in the West that anonymity in art was a cultural norm in Africa. By this thinking, African art is a collective, tribal phenomenon rather than a vehicle for individual expression, and objects of a specific type are _ making allowances for varying degrees of skill _ interchangeable. This view is being challenged head-on by two exhibitions, one in Washington and the other at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Both shows argue that historically, certain traditional Africa artists have not only developed distinctive styles but that those styles were greatly prized within their communities, creating a celebrity that often lived on long after the artists had died. Of the two exhibitions, {{Olowe}} is, by its very nature, {{Olowe}}. Organized by {{Roslyn A. Walker}}, {{Roslyn A. Walker}}, it is a retrospective of a single sculptor who was born around 1875, and died around 1938. One-person shows of Africa artists are rare (the Metropolitan Museum's \"Buli Master\" show, organized by Susan Vogel in 1980, is one of the few other examples). And {{Roslyn A. Walker}} exhibition is truly precedent setting in being accompanied by a catalogue raisonne of {{Olowe}}, {{Olowe}}. As the book itself suggests, biographical data on {{Olowe}} (pronounced o-lo-way of EE-say) is scant, mostly found in local \"praise songs\" composed in {{Roslyn A. Walker}} honor and passed down orally through {{Roslyn A. Walker}} descendants, or in chance scraps of information recorded by colonial visitors. {{Roslyn A. Walker}} was born in southwestern Nigeria of Yoruba people, the ethnic groups from which many African-Americans are descended. {{Roslyn A. Walker}} spent most of {{Roslyn A. Walker}} life working in the court center of Ise, though {{Roslyn A. Walker}} took commissions from clients as far as 60 miles away. {{Roslyn A. Walker}} was {{Roslyn A. Walker}}. {{Olowe}} gained attention in Europe when an elaborate palace door {{Roslyn A. Walker}} had made was displayed in the British Empire Exhibition of 1927 and later acquired by the British Museum. After World War II, an English official saw a picture of the door and related its distinctive style to work he had encountered in Nigeria. He alerted the ethnographer William B. Fagg to his discovery, thus setting in motion the investigation that has culminated in {{Roslyn A. Walker}} show. The British Museum door is not in Washington for the exhibition, which runs through Sept. 7, but two others by {{Olowe}} are, each carved with reliefs of dozens of figures arranged in horizontal bands. The first door depicts the everyday bustle of court life: the ruler, short but commanding, appears accompanied by two wives, one wearing a European-style top hat. A band of eager-to-please musicians serenades him from above; a wrestling match is in progress below. The other door documents a specific event: the turn-of-the-century meeting between a British commissioner named Captain {{Ambrose}} and the King of Ise. Here two cultures, closely observed, come together. {{Ambrose}}, a childlike figure in a cricketing cap, is toted in on a litter from the left. The king, a prepossessing presence in a towering crown, arrives on a horse from the right and greets his guest with a magisterially upraised hand. Many of the characteristics of {{Olowe}} personal style are here: the unusually high relief carving, deep-cut and verging on the three -dimensional; figures with limbs modeled and flexed to give an impression of movement, and surfaces inflected with painterly chipping and faceting. All of these features are also found in the extraordinary veranda posts that {{Olowe}} produced for his royal patrons. Where other artists working with this form carved their stacked-up figures face-front and locked within the column, {{Olowe}} often twists them in different directions, sets their limbs free in space and enlivens them with personable details: a young king has the sweet, alert face of a gazelle; a hunter, rifle in hand, wears his hair in a thick braid, which curves out behind him like a bow. Even more radical is the way Olowe plays with visual and social conventions. In several sculptures he reverses or blends gender roles, giving male figures women's hairdos and dressing them in the beaded girdles worn by brides. Why he did so is a mystery, but one can assume that, like any inventive artist intent on making a name for himself, he upset expectations both to arrest the eye and to keep his public wondering what on earth he would be up to next. The show, which has been evocatively installed with mural-size photographs showing the veranda posts in situ decades ago, ends with some of the artist's smaller pieces, including wooden bowls with cunningly wrought openwork bases and figural motifs seen nowhere else in African art. {{Olowe}} bowls have none of the monumental flair of {{Olowe}} posts and doors, but they are his most frequently imitated work and are unmistakable reminders of his self-consciously virtuosic and original presence. Originality is also the subject of \"Master Hand: Individuality and Creativity Among Yoruba Sculptors,\" a compact think piece of an exhibition at the Met, organized by Alisa LaGamma, assistant curator for the department of the arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. A visual essay on the question of authorship in African art, it expands beyond the crucial figure of {{Olowe}} to touch on numerous other Yoruba artists whose work can be identified either through style or documentation. One of them, {{Areogun}}, was Olowe's near contemporary. A door carved by {{Areogun}} is installed for purposes of stylistic comparison in the Washington show, and the signature image of figures zipping around on bicycles seen there can also be spotted on a large divination bowl at the Met as part of a tableau of human and animals forms woven together in a vibrant chain of activity. Most of the other artists in \"Master Hand\" were born, like {{Olowe}} and {{Areogun}}, in the late 19th century and died in the 20th. And collectively their work attests to the endlessly inventive sophistication of Yoruba art, with its startling interweaving of tradition and modernity. That blend is everywhere. One sees it in a headdress, attributed to Onabanjo, carrying a whole community of figures and touched with baroque flourishes suggesting New World influences carried back to Africa by returning slaves. It is there in a helmet mask, attributed to Bamgbose or {{Areogun}}, topped with the formidable figure of a women flanked by children who reverently touch her breasts. And again in the little dance mask with movable arms, begun by the sculptor Fagbite Asamu in 1930 and completed four decades later by his son Falola Edun. Directly across from the vitrine holding this mask is a video monitor playing 1971 footage of Falola Edun finishing his work on it and then of the mask being worn in a dance, its role as a piece of public art finally realized. Seeing both the Yoruba artist and the sculpture he made \"live\" on tape is very moving, and serves as reminder of the restorative, vivifiying impulse that lies behind the two exhibitions themselves. The Met supplemented \"Master Hand,\" which runs through July 12, with a symposium in February on the question of authorship in Africa art. Among the speakers many individual voices sounded, including that of Olabiyi Babalola Yai from the University of Miami, one of the many Yoruba scholars who are documenting and interpreting their own art. And appropriately, artists were on hand. The Nigerian sculptor Lamidi Fakeye, who had given a carving demonstration in the museum the day before, was in the audience. The symposium was rounded out with the appearance of three contemporary Western artists _ {{Jose Bedia}} _ all of whom live in the United States, but draw on Yoruba-derived African-Caribbean religious traditions in {{Jose Bedia}} art. It was an absorbing, exhausting day, one packed with fresh information, contentious ideas (one scholar suggested that the issue of determining authorship in African art was a Western obsession geared to museums and markets), and, inevitably, with new misconceptions that only further research will set straight. And it felt a very long way indeed from the dusty vitrines and taxidermic science of 30 years ago, when African artists were barely spoken of as artists at all, and the energy of their work was, for one unexpectedly captivated student, a transformative secret just beginning to be revealed."
