{{Charles Johnson}}, whose last novel, "Middle Passage" was a historical reconstruction of slavery, has turned to more recent history in "Dreamer," an imagined account of the last days of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. They are days filled with evil premonitions of the tragedy that was to strike when {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., 30 years ago. The story shifts from {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} interior monologues to the reflections of {{Charles Johnson}}, {{Charles Johnson}} named {{Matthew Bishop}}. {{Matthew Bishop}} is {{Matthew Bishop}}; indeed, one suspects that {{Matthew Bishop}} is modeled on {{Charles Johnson}}. But {{Charles Johnson}} narrative is aimed principally at {{Chaym Smith}} after redemption who bears an uncanny physical resemblance to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}. As a result, {{Chaym Smith}} earns a role as {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} at a time when {{Chaym Smith}} life was clearly in danger. But {{Chaym Smith}} presence gives {{Charles Johnson}} novel the ambiguous, Conradian eeriness of all stories about the doppelganger, the double, the mirror image and the opposite, the reminder of the invisible person who lies behind the mask. These themes are rich, and they are developed by {{Charles Johnson}} with {{Charles Johnson}} usual stylishness. {{Chaym Smith}} has lived {{Chaym Smith}} life shadowed by {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} fame and {{Chaym Smith}} status as a kind of living saint. In {{Charles Johnson}}, {{Charles Johnson}} experience has made {{Charles Johnson}} both jealous and driven, admiring and vengeful. {{Charles Johnson}} reminds us that {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, and "Dreamer" is full of theological reflections. The biblical story of {{Cain}}, whose sacrifice was rather inexplicably rejected by God, resounds through the novel as {{Chaym Smith}} asks why {{Chaym Smith}} has been cursed even as blessings pour down on {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}. "That was {{Chaym Smith}} stuff," {{Chaym Smith}} tells {{Matthew Bishop}} after the two of them have listened to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} speak at a church. "Not things {{Chaym Smith}}'ve ever said, but stuff {{Chaym Smith}}'ve felt. Like {{Chaym Smith}} spirit is trapped in {{Matthew Bishop}}, which is so much clearer and bigger and cleaner." In other words, there are numerous folds to {{Charles Johnson}} psychological intrigue. {{Chaym Smith}} is {{Chaym Smith}}, eloquently irascible, morally deep. And yet "Dreamer" is not a complete success, despite the consistently high quality of {{Charles Johnson}} writing. In the end especially, {{Charles Johnson}} seems to lose control of {{Charles Johnson}} doppelganger theme. Instead, "Dreamer" turns to a muddled theme of betrayal involving an unlikely pair of federal agents and {{Chaym Smith}}. The betrayal seems, at least by virtue of its timing, linked to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} assassination, though this is far from clear. It is as though {{Charles Johnson}} did not know quite what to do with the forces {{Charles Johnson}} has set into motion. {{Charles Johnson}} recourse to a kind of unresolved and implausible mystery leaves the reader with a sense of incompleteness, anticlimax. And while that might be an intentional reflection of the deeper incompleteness of real life, a lesson in the unresolvability of things does not seem to have been {{Charles Johnson}} purpose. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> The action of "Dreamers" takes place mostly in Chicago, where {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, having achieved major victories in the South, has arrived to campaign against Northern forms of racial discrimination. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} is tired and tearful and assailed by doubts. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} wonders in particular if {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} has overestimated the spiritual capacity of blacks and whites alike, whether they are capable of understanding {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} "deeper, esoteric message about freedom," namely that "to gain the dizzying heights of the mountaintop, {{Charles Johnson}} baggage had to be abandoned in the valley." {{Chaym Smith}} arrives at {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} door in the midst of these ruminations. "{{Chaym Smith}} was the kind of Negro the movement had for years kept away from the world's cameras," {{Matthew Bishop}} says of {{Chaym Smith}} appearance: "sullen, ill-kept, the very embodiment of the blues." {{Chaym Smith}} volunteers to be {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} has been unhappily playing most of {{Chaym Smith}} life anyway. When {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} refuses, {{Chaym Smith}} tells {{Chaym Smith}}, "{{Martin Luther King Jr.}} figure if {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}'m catchin' hell 'cause of {{Matthew Bishop}}, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} might's well catch it for {{Matthew Bishop}} instead." {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} agrees to arrange training for {{Chaym Smith}} so {{Chaym Smith}} can be part of the movement, and {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} assigns {{Matthew Bishop}}, the unreciprocating object of {{Matthew Bishop}} desire, to take care of {{Matthew Bishop}}. The story unfolds against a background of increasing urban violence and challenges to {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} from younger, more militant blacks within the ranks. "Dreamer" in this sense takes on a time-capsule flavor. This is sometimes contrived, for example, when {{Matthew Bishop}} find {{Matthew Bishop}} berated as "house niggers" by an ex-con named Yahya Zubena who has found poetry and black power in prison. But the main character remains {{Chaym Smith}}, whose homophonic resemblance to {{Cain}} is made explicit as {{Charles Johnson}} returns again and again to {{Charles Johnson}} biblical theme. "{{Matthew Bishop}} began to see _ as if a veil had lifted _ the tortured shadow of {{Cain}} everywhere, within {{Matthew Bishop}} and without, {{Cain}} many cultural reincarnations parading through {{Matthew Bishop}} mind like frames projected on a cyclorama," {{Matthew Bishop}} tells us. "It was said that Western man {{Cain}} was {{Cain}}, cursed with the burden of restlessness and the endless quest for selfhood. Down through the centuries, {{Cain}} name was spelled differently in different times. Caym, Kaym, even {{Chaym Smith}}, were etymological variations on it." So {{Chaym Smith}}, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}, is {{Cain}}, but {{Chaym Smith}} is {{Chaym Smith}}. Near the end, {{Chaym Smith}}, asked by a pair of rather woodenly constructed FBI men to turn from double to double agent, disappears. Soon after, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} is assassinated. {{Charles Johnson}} seems to be saying something about the collective failure to climb to the mountaintop as well as collective responsibility for {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} death. That is no doubt true, but it is also a nostrum, a commonplace sort of wisdom. And it is unmoored from the deeply personal and individual mystery that {{Chaym Smith}} presented at the outset.
