BELFAST, {{Tony Blair}} flew into Northern Ireland on Tuesday in an urgent effort to remove a serious snag in the peace negotiations between Protestant and Roman Catholic political leaders in this mostly Protestant British province. "{{Tony Blair}} feel the hand of history upon our shoulders," {{Tony Blair}} said on arriving at Hillsborough, a government residence south of Belfast, for a meeting with {{David Trimble}}, {{David Trimble}}. "It's right to try," {{Tony Blair}} said. "{{Tony Blair}}'m here to try." Although {{Tony Blair}} office insisted that {{Tony Blair}} had been scheduled to arrive in Belfast on Tuesday, it was believed here that {{Tony Blair}} arrival had been moved up from Wednesday in response to the potential new crisis. {{David Trimble}} said a set of proposals given to the negotiating parties early Tuesday was unacceptable, a rejection that was widely seen as a melodramatic tactic to take the initiative in peace talks. But the tactic could backfire and push the talks to the brink of a collapse, which would probably turn the melodrama into the tragedy of widespread violence by the main Catholic and Protestant guerrilla groups, which are now observing cease-fires. Sectarian violence has killed more than 3,200 people in the North since 1969. The deadline for an agreement intended to end 800 years of sectarian violence in Ireland has been set for midnight Thursday. And former U.S. Sen. {{George Mitchell}}, D- Maine, the chairman of the talks, said Tuesday morning that the deadline would not be extended and that {{George Mitchell}} job was virtually over after nearly two years. The prime minister arrived hours after the latest, and most serious, obstacle to agreement was advanced by {{David Trimble}}, {{David Trimble}}. {{David Trimble}} said {{George Mitchell}} and have not been made public, were biased in favor of the two Catholic parties, the mainstream Social Democratic Labor and Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. {{Tony Blair}} sought to reassure Protestants by noting that it was British and Irish policy that there will be no united Ireland _ the ultimate goal of the IRA _ unless it is approved by a majority. The Northern Ireland majority is likely to remain Protestant well into the next century. Once {{David Trimble}} makes {{David Trimble}} own proposals in the next two days, the predictable reaction would be rejection by Sinn Fein and possibly the Social Democrats and a rush of last-ditch negotiations to get a compromise agreement by midnight Thursday. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> The Catholics would seek support from the Irish Republic's Prime Minister {{Bertie Ahern}}, while Protestants look to {{Tony Blair}} to argue for them. The Catholics want an agreement that would increase their political power in a new elected lawmaking assembly that would be part of the drastic changes in Northern Ireland's political structure that is envisioned in {{George Mitchell}}. They also want a new cross-border North-South Council, with ministers from Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, that would be authorized to make binding decisions in the North's affairs. Now, the Irish Republic has only a marginal consultative role. Protestants bristle at these demands, seeing them as a way for the Catholics to create a united Ireland, free of British control and run from Dublin. {{George Mitchell}} are known to cover these new government bodies. Protestants want weaker bodies that would be controlled by the Protestant majority that would elected to the new assembly. In a telephone call to {{Tony Blair}} London office, {{David Trimble}} said, {{Tony Blair}} said of {{George Mitchell}}, "Before contemplating alternate proposals, {{David Trimble}} wish to know from {{Tony Blair}} and the Irish government if {{Tony Blair}} are prepared to consider radically different measures." The principal Protestant complaint with the Irish government, a sponsor of the talks with Britain, is that the Irish have refused to specify how they would tone down Ireland's constitutional claim to sovereignty in the North. {{Bertie Ahern}}, who was in Dublin on Tuesday for {{Bertie Ahern}} mother's funeral, did not immediately comment on {{David Trimble}}. {{David Trimble}} was partly motivated by {{David Trimble}} need to stave off the vehement criticism by the Rev. {{Ian Paisley}}, who has kept {{Ian Paisley}} Democratic Unionist Party out of the talks. As {{David Trimble}} was stating {{David Trimble}}, {{Ian Paisley}} was haranguing {{David Trimble}} in television interviews as a traitor who was selling out to Catholic terrorists. {{David Trimble}} and {{Ian Paisley}} compete for Protestant votes in general elections. In a new northern assembly, {{David Trimble}} would be {{David Trimble}}. "{{David Trimble}} can't negotiate by stunts," said {{Seamus Mallon}}, {{Seamus Mallon}}. "This is no stunt," said Jeffrey Donaldson, one of Trimble's Unionist Party allies. "This is for real."
