LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Ranging in price from dlrs 18 for the cheapest first-round seat to dlrs 100 for the most expensive place at the final, tickets for the 1999 Women's World Cup go on sale Friday. Just as for the 1994 men's World Cup, the sale will be in stages with tickets initially available only to the "U.S. Soccer Family" from May 1 - 31. People purchasing tickets then will receive 5 - 15 percent discount. Members of U.S. Soccer Family include members of the U.S. federation, its affiliated organizations, and those whose who have purchased tickets or expressed interest in a U.S. national team game over approximately the past four years. Tickets for the general public will be placed on sale in the fall at date yet to be determined. All tickets at first will have to be purchased in a series, meaning an individual must buy a ticket for each World Cup event at a particular venue, including including quarterfinals and semifinals. A date for single-game sales have not been announced. At the 1994 World Cup, initial sales required individuals to buy tickets for all first- and second-round games at a particular venue. Except for the semifinals, all Women's World Cup events are doubleheaders, including the final, which will be preceeded by the third-place game. That squeezes the 32-game, 16-team tournament, scheduled for June 19 - July 10, 1999, into 17 dates. The least expensive series is dlrs 36 (dlrs 32 for the U.S. family) for the two first-round events at Chicago's Soldier field. The most expensive is dlrs 190 (dlrs 175 for the U.S. family) for the first-round, quarterfinals and semifinal at San Francisco - San Jose, California. About 500,000 tickets will be available, as compared to the approximately 2.5 million for the 1994 men's championship, when prices ranged from dlrs 25 for a first-round match to dlrs 475 for the best seat at the final.
