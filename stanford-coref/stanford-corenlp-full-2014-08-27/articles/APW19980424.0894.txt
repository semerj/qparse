BETWEEN 1996 and last year, only 21.3 per cent, or 42,051, of the 235,000 low-cost houses targeted by the Government under the Seventh Malaysia Plan had been built by the various States, the House was told yesterday. Deputy Minister of Housing and Local Government Peter Chin Fah Kui said of this number, Pahang had achieved 47.34 per cent of its target, Johor 41.77 per cent, Malacca 40.80 per cent and Kuala Lumpur 39.93 per cent. He said the achievement rate for other States was below 30 per cent. Replying to a question by Datuk Mahbud Hashim (BN - Sabak Bernam), he said the Government had taken measures to ensure work on such projects was expedited by the States. The setting up of the National Housing Corporation, he said, would ensure the quality of houses and that developers were more responsible towards low-cost projects. He said under the Seventh Plan, the corporate sector would also be responsible for building low-cost houses.
