SAN'A, Yemen (AP) _ A bomb exploded in a mosque in central San'a Friday, killing three people and wounding 27 others, security officials said. The explosion occurred inside the al-Khair Mosque as scores of Muslims were performing Friday prayers, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity. The injured included two U.S. citizens, a Dutch, a Canadian and several Africans _ all Muslims who were praying in the mosque at the time of the explosion. At least ten of the injured were in critical condition, the officials said. No one took responsibility for the explosion. Yemen, a poor nation of around 17 million on the Arabian peninsula, is still reeling from a 1994 civil war that nearly tore apart the union reached in 1990 between the conservative north and the socialist south. The government says subsequent acts of violence were directed from abroad, but it has not named any country.
