good news started with some wins last year . A handful of beach lovers and staff at McGrath State Beach near Ventura raised half a million dollars for the new sewage system that is keeping that park open . And a nonprofit , the Coe Park Preservation Fund , raised more than a million dollars to protect its namesake park near San Jose .","1":"Institutional neighbors stepped up , too . The National Park Service has pledged to keep Tomales Bay , < Samuel P. Taylor__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > , and Del Norte Coast Redwoods state parks open for at least a year . Counties and cities have offered to provide services at parks within their borders .","2":"`` People are beginning to be mobilized in a way they have n't before , '' said California State Parks Foundation president Elizabeth Goldstein .","3":"At the same time , promising and dedicated grassroots leaders have emerged . To name a few : < Greg Hayes__Greg Hayes:PERSON > , < a former state park superintendent__Greg Hayes:PERSON > , has forsaken retirement to try to < rescue Jack London Historic State Park__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > ; < Kathy Bailey__Kathy Bailey:PERSON > , < a longtime resident of Northern California 's Anderson Valley__Kathy Bailey:PERSON > , is devoting < her__Kathy Bailey:PERSON > days to working with < her__Kathy Bailey:PERSON > neighbors to keep < Hendy Woods State Park__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > open ; < Robert Hanna__Robert Hanna:PERSON > , not long ago a sales manager in a financial firm , has teamed up with activists at several state parks to `` do everything < I__Robert Hanna:PERSON > can to help keep parks open . '' Perhaps < Hanna__Robert Hanna:PERSON > was destined to be a leader ; < he__Robert Hanna:PERSON > is < John Muir 's 31-year-old great-great grandson__Robert Hanna:PERSON > . Somehow this crisis has led < him__Robert Hanna:PERSON > and dozens of other Californians to a new calling : preserving state parks .","4":"Inside and outside the bureaucracy , the crisis has highlighted some not-so-new ideas . At < Samuel P. Taylor State Park__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > , in Marin , supervising ranger Rose Blackburn is reassessing her use of volunteer campground hosts . In exchange for free RV space , they work 20 hours a week helping park visitors and handling emergencies . In peak season , she now has two campground hosts and may expand that to three or four , with one host concentrating on maintenance . One surefire revenue enhancement at < Taylor__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > is a new lodging option : five new primitive cabins that she hopes will be ready for visitors this summer , at $ 100 a night or so -LRB- compared with $ 35 for a campsite -RRB- .","5":"In the past , some parks neglected collecting fees , partly because the revenue went to Sacramento to be shared among all the parks . Now new models are being explored . At Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve , for example , the nonprofit Bodie Foundation will collect a $ 3 parking fee to be invested right back into Mono .","6":"Save the Redwoods League 's executive director Ruskin Hartley said basic entry fees to state parks should be kept low to ensure people can afford to visit , `` but that does n't mean you should pay the same amount to camp on July 4th as you would on January 4th . ''","7":"In Sonoma , the county parks department and the nonprofit organization LandPaths hope to build support by reintroducing parks to local communities in places like < Annadel State Park__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > .","8":"`` We 'd start by bringing out kids from every single school in Santa Rosa within walking distance , '' said LandPaths ' executive director Craig Anderson . `` We 'd see if senior communities could have picnics at the trailhead . We 'd see if we could entice the 30-somethings with something kind of edgy and fresh . ''","9":"The Napa County parks department has suggested pooling government resources to run parks more efficiently . For example , the county sheriff might set up a substation on state park land in exchange for keeping an eye on < Bothe-Napa State Park__Samuel P. Taylor:PERSON > . Cities and counties have also offered to help with trash pickup and other services on state park lands near facilities they already manage .","10":"The state Legislative Analyst 's Office -LRB- LAO -RRB- also had efficiency in mind when it challenged a rule requiring all state park rangers to have peace-officer -LRB- police -RRB- training . As a March 2012 LAO report states , `` While some ranger duties , such as responding to emergencies and making arrests , require peace officer status , many of them do not -LRB- such as managing staff , providing information to visitors , and leading school groups on tours -RRB- . '' Reducing the number of peace officers could reduce state parks ' expenses by at least a few million dollars , the report said .","11":"A few additional millions could be garnered by the passage of the California State Parks Stewardship Act of 2012 , A.B. 1589 . Introduced by Jared Huffman -LRB- D-San Rafael -RRB- in February , the bill would allow residents to buy an annual state park pass when filing tax returns , and introduces a special state park license plate . It also sets up a fund that would pool $ 25 million in unused bond money to pay for the installation of revenue and fee collection equipment and technologies to increase park visitation and revenues , among other measures . The bill passed out of its first committee unanimously last week .","12":"This is just a small sampling of the promising ideas that have emerged in the past few months . They are not enough to counter the problems that will arise from the state 's meat-ax approach to budget cutting . Dozens of parks are expected to close on July 1 , and they will be damaged -- perhaps permanently . The jury is still out on whether closures will actually save money .","13":"But the shock of closures has also had its benefits , moving California toward more government cooperation , energized nonprofit leadership , and generous private contributions of time and money . The parks idea of the early 20th century is being updated for the 21st century with broad , sometimes angry , but decidedly engaged public participation . People are joining their neighbors . They 're reconnecting with their parks .","14":"Internal Revenue Service and Drug Enforcement Administration agents raided Oaksterdam University , which describes itself as `` America 's first cannabis college . '' It was also the center of the 2010 campaign to legalize marijuana in California .","15":"Agents also raided < Lee 's home__Richard Lee:PERSON > and the former site of < Lee 's__Richard Lee:PERSON > medical marijuana dispensary Coffeeshop Blue Sky , which has been operating as an underground pot club .","16":"Separately , federal agents raided the Oakland Hills home of < Todd McCormick__Todd McCormick:PERSON > , < a longtime medical marijuana activist__Todd McCormick:PERSON > , < DEA spokeswoman Joycelyn Barnes__Joycelyn Barnes:PERSON > confirmed . < McCormick__Todd McCormick:PERSON > was arrested for growing pot soon after the state legalized medical marijuana in 1996 and currently grows put for patients , sources said .","17":"Agents entered < Lee 's home__Richard Lee:PERSON > with guns early Monday morning , said Dale Sky Jones , chancellor of Oaksterdam . < Lee__Richard Lee:PERSON > , who uses a wheelchair , was detained for a few hours Monday morning at < his home__Richard Lee:PERSON > and then released , sources said .

Every year an average of 14 million tons of garbage make it into the world 's oceans , swept along by gyres and finding its way to coastlines where marine animals consume it or become entangled -- often with deadly effect .","519":"Several models predict that if the tsunami debris collects anywhere , in about three years ' time that place will likely be near the center of the Pacific Ocean at what 's been termed the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . University of Hawaii , Manoa researchers are concentrating their search for tsunami debris on the western coastline of the island of Midway , an atoll in the middle of the Pacific garbage patch .","520":"`` The problem is going to be knowing which pieces come from Japan and which did n't , '' said < John Largier__John Largier:PERSON > , a University of California , < Davis oceanographer.Scientists__Davis:PERSON > are using small electronic transmitters , called trackers , to follow the tsunami debris . < They__Davis:PERSON > have also enlisted the help of the shipping industry to report patches . Early reports show that much of it is breaking up and sinking to the ocean floor . Some of it is also expected to reach the West Coast of the Americas this fall or winter , a full 18 months after the disaster struck Japan . An unmanned Japanese fishing trawler was recently discovered off the coast of British Columbia , a ghostly reminder of the tragedy .","521":"Some news stations have reported that `` huge amounts of debris are bound for the California coastline . '' But scientists say do n't expect a deluge of trash . And despite the nuclear meltdown in Japan , radioactivity will not be on its way , since the meltdown occurred after the tsunami washed the debris to sea . As the debris moves , it 's dissipating throughout the ocean like a scatter-plot .","522":"`` People have in their minds that it 's going to be this big tsunami , but that 's just not true , '' saidCarey Morishige , Pacific Islands regional coordinator for NOAA .","523":"By the time the currents carry the tsunami debris to California shores , residents can expect anything from a slight spike in loose detritus along the shores to nothing terribly out of the ordinary . If it collects anywhere in the Bay Area , those places are likely certain high-deposition beaches , such as China Beach in San Francisco and Muir Beach in West Marin , where currents flowing around the Golden Gate bring trash to shore . Certain beaches are depositional by the way the waves break on them , bringing debris , '' said < Largier__John Largier:PERSON > . `` In this region , the onshore winter winds tend to push things onshore quite effectively . After a winter storm , the winds blow directly on shore . `` Gulf of Farallones scientists are paying close attention to the Humboldt Current as it runs along the West Coast . This current is one of the world 's most productive , and in the winter , it shifts to a counter-current . This shift in the ocean 's current is just one of the many factors that make predicting where and when the debris appear so difficult .","524":"A full ocean cleanup of the tsunami debris is out of the question . The best that can come of it is a better understanding of where it 's going and the environmental damage it may be causing . It 's even possible that a more accurate picture might bolster efforts to address the bigger issue of ocean garbage.In tracking tsunami debris , < Schramm__Mary Jane Schramm:PERSON > said the public can also help . `` Volunteers have been given specific reporting -LSB- instructions -RSB- , '' she said . `` If they happen to notice a sharp increase , or you know , something with Japanese writing on it , they can report it . `` NOAA is asking the public to report any unusual debris that may be linked to the Japanese tsunami to : disasterdebris@noaa.gov .","525":"< Scott Paul__Scott Paul:PERSON > , < the executive director of the Alliance for American Manufacturing__Scott Paul:PERSON > , said , `` It was a stupid , shortsighted decision '' to use steel from China for the bridge project .","526":"< Paul__Scott Paul:PERSON > said < he__Scott Paul:PERSON > does n't think using steel from China will save taxpayers any money and if Caltrans had used steel from the U.S. thousands of jobs would have been created for American workers .","527":"One of the signs is east of the Bay Bridge toll plaza and the other is off Interstate Highway 880 near High Street in Oakland .","528":"The billboards feature a bright red Chinese flag and say , `` The Bay Bridge 100 percent foreign steel '' and include the alliance 's website .","529":"< Paul__Scott Paul:PERSON > said the alliance 's `` Should Be Made in America '' campaign is aimed at sparking changes in federal , state and local procurement policies .","530":"< He__Scott Paul:PERSON > said the U.S. needs to repair trillions of dollars in crumbling infrastructure over the next decade , including nearly $ 500 billion worth in California alone , and the campaign is arguing that the most effective boost to the U.S. economy would be to ensure that U.S. firms are given the work whenever permissible under existing trade obligations .","531":"% related % Paul said 20 U.S. states are currently considering , or have recently passed , legislation to provide preferences for American steel and manufactured goods in state-level procurement .","532":"< John Goodwin__John Goodwin:PERSON > , < a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission , which helped coordinate funding for the Bay Bridge work__John Goodwin:PERSON > , said the billboards have misleading information .","533":"< He__John Goodwin:PERSON > said 76 percent of the steel used for the new eastern span was fabricated in < the U.S. Goodwin__John Goodwin:PERSON > said the only portion using steel from China is the self-anchored suspension span , which is 2,047 feet long .","534":"< Goodwin__John Goodwin:PERSON > said the main contractors for the eastern span are two American companies , Fluor , which is based in Texas , and American Bridge , which is based in Pennsylvania .","535":"< He__John Goodwin:PERSON > said those companies , not the MTC or Caltrans , chose ZPMC , which has a steel fabrication plant in Shanghai , to supply the steel for the self-anchored suspension span .","536":"< Caltrans spokesman Bart Ney__Bart Ney:PERSON > said ZPMC was chosen because no American companies had the capacity to provide the steel needed for the span .","537":"< He__Bart Ney:PERSON > said having an American company provide the steel `` was not a possibility then and still is n't a possibility now .

The mandate is at the heart of the legal challenge , and supporters say that the Act can not survive without it .","727":"That may be true . But the mandate , no matter how important , is just one part of the law , and most of the pieces that have taken effect so far are much more popular .","728":"One is a requirement that insurance companies let families keep their adult children on their policies until age 26 . Before the law was passed , adult children who were not in college were typically knocked off their parents ' family coverage , and many then went without insurance . It 's estimated that more than 350,000 young California adults are taking advantage of this provision to keep their coverage .","729":"Another major change is a provision prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage to children with pre-existing medical conditions . Once this rule took effect , some insurers doing business in California said they would simply stop selling kids ' coverage . But a new state law now requires them to sell those policies if they want to sell any insurance here . So families with sick kids now find it easier to get coverage for them .","730":"Adults with pre-existing conditions can still be denied private coverage , until 2014 . But in the meantime , California , using new federal money , has expanded a high-risk pool for people who have been shut out of the private insurance market . Nearly 9,000 people who were without coverage before have been accepted into that program .","731":"Every Californian with private coverage is also benefitting from other parts of the law . One provision prohibits insurance companies from imposing lifetime limits on the costs that people can have covered . Another phases out the annual limits on costs that many insurers have included as part of their policies . Still another piece of the law requires insurance companies to provide preventive care without out-of-pocket costs .","732":"And there is more . A major goal of the Act is the expansion of coverage for low-income Americans who have not received coverage through work , could not afford to buy it on their own but did not qualify for public programs designed for the very poor .","733":"With new federal money , California counties are creating or expanding what are known as Low-Income Health Plans , similar to the Medi-Cal program , but for people with higher incomes or who do not have children . So far , nearly 400,000 people in 47 counties have been enrolled in these programs . In 2014 , they will become part of Medi-Cal , and the federal government will continue to pick up the cost of their care .","734":"California has also begun implementing what could become the most important piece of the new health care system : the creation of a Health Benefits Exchange . This will be an online marketplace where businesses and individuals can shop for coverage . The plans will be standardized and grouped into levels of coverage -- gold , silver , bronze -- so that consumers can see clearly what benefits are available and how much each plan would cost , including deductibles and co-payments . Subsidies will be available for consumers with incomes up to four times the federal poverty level , or nearly $ 90,000 a year for a family of four .","735":"The Exchange is expected to facilitate coverage for several million Californians who do n't have insurance now . Others will move to the Exchange if they lose employer-based coverage . Health insurance experts expect some employers to drop their coverage once the Exchange becomes a viable alternative for their workers , despite financial penalties for doing so . Eventually , the state-run marketplace could become the biggest seller of insurance in California .","736":"All of this has been done without the mandate on individuals that will be the subject of next week 's Supreme Court hearings .","737":"The court is expected to rule on the case in June , and unless the justices strike it down completely , the issue will probably be a big part of the presidential campaign later this year . Republicans have vowed to repeal the law if they get the chance , even though < their likely nominee__Mitt Romney:PERSON > , < Mitt Romney__Mitt Romney:PERSON > , signed a very similar plan when he was governor of Massachusetts .","738":"But even if < Romney or another Republican__Mitt Romney:PERSON > is elected president and the Republicans take control of the US Senate , it 's unlikely < they__Mitt Romney:PERSON > will follow through with < their__Mitt Romney:PERSON > threat to repeal the entire law .","739":"Many pieces of the Act are popular even with Republican voters and the business community , and the parts expanding coverage for the poor are really more about the safety net than insurance .","740":"So unless the Supreme Court invalidates the entire law , the Affordable Care Act , or most of it anyway , is probably here to stay .","741":"The sunlight peeking through the shadows of buildings and trees reminded < Lani of the rickshaw obscura , a mobile camera obscura__Lani:PERSON > to be housed inside a rickshaw .

The minimum currently is $ 1.46 an hour per worker , which adds up to $ 607 a year for an eight-hour-a-week worker .","1459":"Employers have three ways of meeting that requirement . One is to provide health insurance . Another option is to enroll their employees in Healthy San Francisco .

The amendment also required employers to actively inform workers that they have the health care benefit and a reimbursement account . One study found there was an incentive in the previous system for employers to not promote the existence of these accounts so employees would n't use them .","1468":"But < Campos ' office__David Campos:PERSON > expressed frustration that this solution was merely a patch .","1469":"`` < It__David Campos:PERSON > does n't really close the loophole , '' said Hillary Ronen , < Campos '__David Campos:PERSON > chief of staff . `` Businesses that do follow the rules and provide health coverage to employees through insurance or Healthy San Francisco , they have to unfairly compete with those paying less into health reimbursement accounts . ''","1470":"Because employers can still take money back from reimbursement accounts , there is still a monetary incentive , she said , for employers to choose them over insurance .","1471":"`` The issues remain , '' she said , adding that allowing employers to take some of the money back leaves an incentive for employers to limit the type of reimbursable expenses that workers can use .","1472":"The Labor Standards Enforcement Office , meanwhile , wo n't receive reports for 2011 until April . `` It 's too early to tell whether the amendment made a difference , '' said Donna Levitt , a division manager .","1473":"Those discussions became more intense over the weekend , after the San Francisco Superior Court 's Appellate Division ruled on Friday that jurors could see a video of < Mirkarimi 's wife__Mirkarimi:PERSON > , < Eliana Lopez__Eliana Lopez:PERSON > , revealing a bruise that < she__Mirkarimi:PERSON > claimed resulted from an argument with < her__Mirkarimi:PERSON > husband on Dec. 31 .","1474":"The ruling was the latest in a series of setbacks for the legal teams representing < Mirkarimi__Mirkarimi:PERSON > and < his wife__Mirkarimi:PERSON > , who had made several different attempts to persuade judges to exclude the video and other evidence or dismiss the case entirely .","1475":"On Sunday night , < Mirkarimi__Mirkarimi:PERSON > and < his__Mirkarimi:PERSON > attorneys finalized the details of the plea agreement . < He__Mirkarimi:PERSON > would plead guilty to one misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment ; in exchange , prosecutors would dismiss three misdeameanor charges -- domestic violence battery , child endangerment and dissuading a witness -- that could have resulted in a one-year jail sentence .","1476":"% related % On Monday morning , as prospective jurors waited to be interviewed by prosecutors and defense attorneys in the case , < Mirkarimi__Mirkarimi:PERSON > entered < his__Mirkarimi:PERSON > plea in in San Francisco 's Superior Court .","1477":"When the judge asked him if anyone threatened or pressured him to make a plea , < Mirkarimi__Mirkarimi:PERSON > paused for a few moments , before shaking his head and quietly saying `` no .

The price is a new high for California Cabernet Sauvignon , but it is not the highest . Diamond Creek 1985 Lake Vineyard Cabernet weighed in this fall with a sticker price of $ 100 a bottle .","2416":"One of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of superpremiums -- wines limited in production , of exceptional quality -LRB- or so perceived , at any rate -RRB- , and with exceedingly high prices . For years , this group included a stable of classics -- Bordeaux first growths -LRB- Lafite-Rothschild , Latour , Haut-Brion , Petrus -RRB- , Grand Cru Burgundies -LRB- Romanee-Conti and La Tache -RRB- deluxe Champagnes -LRB- Dom Perignon or Roederer Cristal -RRB- , rarefied sweet wines -LRB- Chateau Yquem or Trockenbeerenauslesen Rieslings from Germany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello Riserva from Tuscany -RRB- . These first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ 40 to $ 125 a bottle .","2417":"In the last year or so , however , this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members . The classics have zoomed in price to meet the competition , and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the priciest single bottle , among current releases from every major wine region on the globe .","2418":"France can boast the lion 's share of high-priced bottles . Bordeaux 's first growths from 1985 and 1986 are $ 60 to $ 80 each -LRB- except for the smallest in terms of production , Chateau Petrus , which costs around $ 250 ! -RRB- . These prices seem rather modest , however , in light of other French wines from current vintages . Chateau Yquem , the leading Sauternes , now goes for well over $ 100 a bottle for a lighter vintage like 1984 ; the spectacularly rich 1983 runs $ 179 .","2419":"In Champagne , some of the prestige cuvees are inching toward $ 100 a bottle . The first Champagne to crack that price barrier was the 1979 Salon de Mesnil Blanc de Blancs . The '82 Salon is $ 115 . Roederer Cristal at $ 90 a bottle sells out around the country and Taittinger 's Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs is encroaching upon that level . The great reds of the Rhone Valley have soared in price as well . E. Guigal 's 1982 Cote Rotie La Landonne , for example , is $ 120 .","2420":"None of France 's wine regions can steal a march on Burgundy , however . The six wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti , 72 of the most precious acres of vineyard anywhere in the world , have commanded three-digit price tags for several years now . With the 1985 vintage , they soared higher : La Tache , $ 195 ; Richebourg , $ 180 ; Romanee-Conti , $ 225 . Another small Burgundy estate , Coche-Dury , has just offered its 1987 Corton-Charlemagne for $ 155 .","2421":"From Italy there is Angelo Gaja Barbaresco at $ 125 a bottle , Piero Antinori 's La Solaia , a $ 90 Cabernet from Tuscany , and Biondi-Santi Brunello at $ 98 . Spain 's Vega Secilia Unico 1979 -LRB- released only in its 10th year -RRB- is $ 70 , as is Australia 's Grange Hermitage 1982 .","2422":"`` There are certain cult wines that can command these higher prices , '' says < Larry Shapiro of Marty 's , one of the largest wine shops in Dallas__Larry Shapiro:PERSON > . `` What 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out .

Some of the newer wines , even at $ 90 to $ 100 a bottle or so , almost offer a bargain . ''","2424":"Take Lake Vineyard Cabernet from Diamond Creek . It 's made only in years when the grapes ripen perfectly -LRB- the last was 1979 -RRB- and comes from a single acre of grapes that yielded a mere 75 cases in 1987 . Owner Al Brownstein originally planned to sell it for $ 60 a bottle , but when a retailer in Southern California asked , `` Is that wholesale or retail ? '' he re-thought the matter . Offering the wine at roughly $ 65 a bottle wholesale -LRB- $ 100 retail -RRB- , he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers : 1 -RRB- no , the wine is too high -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- yes , it 's high but I 'll take it -LRB- 2 responses -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- I 'll take all I can get -LRB- 58 responses -RRB- .

We got our two six-packs -- and they 're gone . ''","2426":"< Mr. Pratt__Sterling Pratt:PERSON > remarked that < he__Sterling Pratt:PERSON > thinks steeper prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on . Even if there is consumer resistance at first , a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move . `` There may be sticker-shock reaction initially , '' said < Mr. Pratt__Sterling Pratt:PERSON > , `` but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell , they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the astronomical price to add it to their collection . ''","2427":"`` It 's just sort of a one-upsmanship thing with some people , '' added < Larry Shapiro__Larry Shapiro:PERSON > . `` They like to talk about having the new Red Rock Terrace -LCB- one of Diamond Creek 's Cabernets -RCB- or the Dunn 1985 Cabernet , or the Petrus . Producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people . ''","2428":"That explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly . But consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago . `` They wo n't buy if the quality is not there , '' said < Cedric Martin of Martin Wine Cellar in New Orleans__Cedric Martin:PERSON > . `` Or if they feel the wine is overpriced and they can get something equally good for less . '' < Mr. Martin__Cedric Martin:PERSON > has increased prices on some wines -LRB- like Grgich Hills Chardonnay , now $ 32 -RRB- just to slow down movement , but < he__Cedric Martin:PERSON > is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red Burgundies and Cabernets and Chardonnays in the $ 30 to $ 40 range .","2429":"Image has , of course , a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't , and it ca n't be forced . Wine merchants ca n't keep Roederer Cristal in stock , but they have to push Salon le Mesnil , even lowering the price from $ 115 to $ 90 . It 's hardly a question of quality -- the 1982 Salon is a beautiful wine , but , as < Mr. Pratt__Sterling Pratt:PERSON > noted , people have their own ideas about value .","2430":"It 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door . In every major market in the U.S. , for instance , you can buy '86 La Tache or Richebourg , virtually all of the first growth Bordeaux -LRB- except Petrus -RRB- , as well as Opus One and Dominus from California and , at the moment , the Stag 's Leap 1985 Cask 23 .","2431":"With the biggest wine-buying period of the year looming as the holidays approach , it will be interesting to see how the superpremiums fare .

In 1973 , Wells Fargo & Co. of San Francisco launched the Gold Account , which included free checking , a credit card , safe-deposit box and travelers checks for a $ 3 monthly fee .","2543":"The concept begot a slew of copycats , but the banks stopped promoting the packages . One big reason : thin margins . Many banks , particularly smaller ones , were slow to computerize and could n't target market niches that would have made the programs more profitable . As banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s , the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs .","2544":"But now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age , income and geography . They are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s . Deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits , as well as opened up the field for new products such as high-rate CDs . Where a bank once offered a standard passbook savings account , it began offering money-market accounts , certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking , and staggering rates based on the size of deposits .","2545":"The competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis and Chemical Banking Corp. of New York extend their market-share battles into small towns across the nation . `` Today , a banker is worrying about local , regional and money-center -LCB- banks -RCB- , as well as thrifts and credit unions , '' says Ms. Moore at Synergistics Research . `` So people who were n't even thinking about targeting 10 years ago are scrambling to define their customer base .

''","2547":"Packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place . For their troubles , the banks get a larger captive audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate . The more accounts customers have , < Mr. Sullivan__Michael P. Sullivan:PERSON > says , the more likely they are to be attracted to a package -- and to be loyal to the bank that offers it . That can pay off down the road as customers , especially the younger ones , change from borrowers to savers\/investors .","2548":"Packaging has some drawbacks . The additional technology , personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive . Chemical Bank spent more than $ 50 million to introduce its ChemPlus line , several packages aimed at different segments , in 1986 , according to < Thomas Jacob__Thomas Jacob:PERSON > , senior vice president of marketing . `` It 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive , and make it pay , '' < Mr. Jacob__Thomas Jacob:PERSON > says .","2549":"Still , bankers expect packaging to flourish , primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs . `` These days , banking customers walk in the door expecting < you__Thomas Jacob:PERSON > to have a package especially for them , '' Ms. Moore says .

Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors '' ASLACTON , England -- Of all scenes that evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest : An ancient stone church stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from its tower , calling the faithful to evensong .","2586":"The parishioners of St. Michael and All Angels stop to chat at the church door , as members here always have . In the tower , five men and women pull rhythmically on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in 1614 .","2587":"But there is also a discordant , modern note in Aslacton , though it ca n't be heard by the church-goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .","2588":"Like most of the other 6,000 churches in Britain with sets of bells , St. Michael once had its own `` band '' of ringers , who would herald every Sunday morning and evening service . Now , only one local ringer remains : < 64-year-old Derek Hammond__Derek Hammond:PERSON > .","2589":"The others here today live elsewhere . They belong to a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bells sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia .","2590":"`` To ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , '' says < Mr. Hammond__Derek Hammond:PERSON > , < a retired water-authority worker__Derek Hammond:PERSON > . `` We 've tried to train the youngsters , but they have their discos and their dances , and they just drift away . ''","2591":"< Mr. Hammond__Derek Hammond:PERSON > worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that keeps the Aslacton bells pealing . History , after all , is not on < his__Derek Hammond:PERSON > side . According to a nationwide survey taken a year ago , nearly a third of England 's church bells are no longer rung on Sundays because there is no one to ring them .","2592":"It is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes . The less complicated version of playing tunes on bells , as do the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English to be childish , fit only for foreigners . Change-ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the English invented 380 years ago , requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined with intense mental concentration .","2593":"Proper English bells are started off in `` rounds , '' from the highest-pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells . Then , at a signal , the ringers begin varying the order in which the bells sound without altering the steady rhythm of the striking . Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state . Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known as `` methods , '' which have odd-sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters . A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .","2594":"A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved . Ten shirt-sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize-fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber . No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves , muffled by the ceiling . Totally absorbed , the ringers stare straight ahead , using peripheral vision -LRB- they call it `` rope-sight '' -RRB- to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls .","2595":"Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position . Skilled ringers use their wrists to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .","2596":"In a well-known detective-story involving church bells , English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . '' Ringers , she added , are `` filled with the solemn intoxication that comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed . ''","2597":"`` Ringing does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits Stephanie Pattenden , master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of England 's best female ringers .","2598":"It is a passion that usually stays in the tower , however . More often than not , ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the belfry . When their changes are completed , and after they have worked up a sweat , ringers often skip off to the local pub , leaving worship for others below .","2599":"This does not sit well with some clerics . With membership of the Church of England steadily dwindling , strong-willed vicars are pressing equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringers to attend services . Two years ago , the Rev. < Jeremy Hummerstone__Jeremy Hummerstone:PERSON > , < vicar of Great Torrington__Jeremy Hummerstone:PERSON > , Devon , got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service < he__Jeremy Hummerstone:PERSON > sacked the entire band ; the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest . `` They were a self-perpetuating club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' the Vicar Hummerstone says .","2600":"An entirely new band rings today at Great Torrington , several of whom are members of the congregation . But there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells .","2601":"At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have fallen silent following a dust-up over church attendance . < The vicar__W.D. Jones:PERSON > , < W.D. Jones__W.D. Jones:PERSON > , refuses to talk about it , saying it would `` reopen the wound . '' But < C.J.B. Marshall , vicar of a nearby church__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > , feels the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that are located next to the altar . `` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringers from above , making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' < he__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > says .","2602":"< Vicar Marshall__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since < he__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > is both < a vicar__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > and an active bell-ringer himself . `` The sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church , '' < he__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > says . `` < I__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that fuller life . ''","2603":"The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers , a sort of parliament of ringing groups , aims to improve relations with vicars , says < John C. Baldwin__John C. Baldwin:PERSON > , president . It hopes to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitled , `` The Bells in < Your__C.J.B. Marshall:PERSON > Care . '' Says < Mr. Baldwin__John C. Baldwin:PERSON > , `` We recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''","2604":"< Mr. Baldwin__John C. Baldwin:PERSON > is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers . One survey says that of the 100,000 trained bellringers in England today , only 40,000 of them still ring . Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be rung -- like in small , rural parishes and inner-city churches .","2605":"But the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says < Mr. Baldwin__John C. Baldwin:PERSON > . `` Right now , we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' < he__John C. Baldwin:PERSON > adds .","2606":"One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are women . They are n't accepted everywhere , however . The oldest bell-ringing group in the country , the Ancient Society of College Youths , founded in 1637 , remains male-only , a fact that 's particularly galling to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for Britain 's most prestigious churches , St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey .","2607":"This being Britain , no woman has filed an equal-opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` The Ringing World , '' a weekly newspaper for ringers . One writer , signing his letter as `` Red-blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of women fainting in peals , '' and suggested that they `` settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings . ''","2608":"In the torrent of replies that followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be desired : badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . '' Another women wrote from Sheffield to say that in her 60 years of ringing , `` I have never known a lady to faint in the belfry . I have seen one or two men die , bless them . ''","2609":"Investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable arrival of quarterly dividend checks . That has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than 10 % .","2610":"But do n't breathe too easy : Those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices , some analysts warn .","2611":"In the past , they say , the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over .","2612":"That can be a trap for unwary investors , says < Richard Bernstein__Richard Bernstein:PERSON > , senior quantitative analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. . Strong dividend growth , < he__Richard Bernstein:PERSON > says , is `` the black widow of valuation '' -- a reference to the female spiders that attract males and then kill them after mating .","2613":"< Stephen Boesel__Stephen Boesel:PERSON > , < president of T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund__Stephen Boesel:PERSON > , explains that companies raise their payouts most robustly only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time . `` Invariably , those strong periods in the economy give way to recessionary environments , '' < he__Stephen Boesel:PERSON > says . `` And recessionary environments are n't hospitable to the stock market . ''","2614":"Indeed , analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical peaks . In 1976 , for example , dividends on the stocks in Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index soared 10 % , following much slower growth the year before . The S&P index started sliding in price in September 1976 , and fell 12 % in 1977 -- despite a 15 % expansion in dividends that year .","2615":"That pattern has n't always held , but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious . Payouts on the S&P 500 stocks rose 10 % in 1988 , according to Standard & Poor 's Corp. , and Wall Street estimates for 1989 growth are generally between 9 % and 14 % . Many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year , although a minority see double-digit gains continuing .","2616":"Meanwhile , many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag : While dividends have risen smartly , their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices . As a result , the market 's dividend yield -- dividends as a percentage of price -- has slid to a level that is fairly low and unenticing by historical standards .","2617":"Put another way , the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay , some market analysts say . They are keeping a close watch on the yield on the S&P 500 . The figure is currently about 3.3 % , up from 3.2 % before the recent market slide . Some analysts say investors should run for the exits if a sustained market rebound pushes the yield below 3 % .","2618":"A drop below that 3 % benchmark `` has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued , '' says Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price .","2619":"In fact , `` the market has always tanked . Always . There 's never been an exception , '' says < Gerald W. Perritt__Gerald W. Perritt:PERSON > , a Chicago investment adviser and money manager , based on a review of six decades of stock-market data .","2620":"The last time the S&P 500 yield dropped below 3 % was in the summer of 1987 . Stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the October debacle .","2621":"There have been only seven other times -- in 1929 , 1933 , 1961 , 1965 , 1968 , 1971 and 1972 -- when the yield on the S&P 500 dropped below 3 % for at least two consecutive months , < Mr. Perritt__Gerald W. Perritt:PERSON > found . And in each case , < he__Gerald W. Perritt:PERSON > says , a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year .","2622":"Still , some market analysts say the current 3.3 % reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past . `` It 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not behaving in a traditional manner , '' says < James H. Coxon , head of stock investments for Cigna Corp. , the Philadelphia-based insurer__James H. Coxon:PERSON > .","2623":"In particular , < Mr. Coxon__James H. Coxon:PERSON > says , businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically . So , while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends , they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength .","2624":"Rather than increasing dividends , some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares , notes < Steven G. Einhorn__Steven G. Einhorn:PERSON > , co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman , Sachs & Co. . He factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about 3.6 % . That is just a tad below the average of the past 40 years or so , he says .","2625":"What will happen to dividend growth next year ? Common wisdom suggests a single-digit rate of growth , reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits .","2626":"PaineWebber Inc. , for instance , is forecasting growth in S&P 500 dividends of just under 5 % in 1990 , down from an estimated 11 % this year . In other years in which there have been moderate economic slowdowns -- the environment the firm expects in 1990 -- the change in dividends ranged from a gain of 4 % to a decline of 1 % , according to PaineWebber analyst Thomas Doerflinger .","2627":"The minority argument , meanwhile , is that businesses have the financial wherewithal this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken .","2628":"Dividend growth on the order of 12 % is expected by both < Mr. Coxon of Cigna__James H. Coxon:PERSON > and < Mr. Einhorn__Steven G. Einhorn:PERSON > of Goldman Sachs . Those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures .","2629":"One indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from Standard & Poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends . A total of 139 companies raised dividends in October , basically unchanged from 138 a year ago , S&P said Wednesday . That followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace .","2630":"While the S&P tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes , a further slippage in the number of dividend increases could be a harbinger of slower dividend growth next year .","2631":"In any case , opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels . Mr. Einhorn of Goldman Sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a 12 % to 15 % total return from appreciation and dividends over the next 12 months -- vs. a `` cash rate of return '' of perhaps 7 % or 8 % if dividend growth is weak .","2632":"But Mr. Boesel of T. Rowe Price , who also expects 12 % growth in dividends next year , does n't think it will help the overall market all that much . `` Having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook , but I do n't think it 's a main consideration , '' he says . With slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year , `` I would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels .

Homeless people not only lack safety , privacy and shelter , they also lack the elementary necessities of nutrition , cleanliness and basic health care . In a recent report , the Institute of Medicine pointed out that certain health problems may predispose a person to homelessness , others may be a consequence of it , and a third category is composed of disorders whose treatment is difficult or impossible if a person lacks adequate shelter .

'' This phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through Congress . It signals Congress 's attempt , under the pretext of guarding the public purse , to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in Article II of the Constitution .","2884":"This species of congressional action is predicated on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is erroneous and unconstitutional . The appropriations clause states that `` No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law ... '' The prevailing interpretation of the clause on Capitol Hill is that it gives Congress an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of the president through the ability to withhold funding . This interpretation was officially endorsed by Congress in 1987 in the Iran-Contra Report .","2885":"As partisans of congressional power understand , a `` power of the purse '' so broadly construed would emasculate the presidency and swallow the principle of separation of powers . It is not supported by the text or history of the Constitution .","2886":"The framers hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to < Madison 's__Madison:PERSON > notes . To the extent they did , their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability . Moreover , the framers believed that the nation needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed poorly under the Articles of Confederation . It would contradict that objective if the appropriations clause -LRB- technically a limitation on legislative power -RRB- could be read as placing the president on Congress 's short leash , making the executive consist of the president and every member of Congress .","2887":"As it went to the conference panel now deliberating , the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal 1990 contained some breathtaking attempts by Congress to rewrite the Constitution under the pretext of protecting the public 's money . During the coming weeks , < President Bush__Bush:PERSON > must decide whether to veto the bills containing them -- or , alternatively , to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their intrusions on executive power to be in violation of Article II , and thus void and severable .","2888":"The 1990 appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of < his__Bush:PERSON > powers to make certain appointments as provided by Article II . Article II places on the president the duty to nominate , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate '' appoint , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of the U.S. . It also empowers the president to make recess appointments , without Senate approval : `` The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate , by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session . ''","2889":"Yet Section 605 of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other Act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been nominated after the Senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person . '' Thus , with one brief passage in an appropriations bill , Congress repeals the president 's power to make recess appointments under Article II .","2890":"Section 605 also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to nominate candidates of his choosing . The language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected nominee will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary . The president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits voluntary service to the government .","2891":"The 1990 appropriations bills also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that violate the recommendation clause in Article II of the Constitution . Muzzling provisions , which might be called `` blindfold laws '' as well , prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options , let alone from recommending them to Congress . Such laws violate the provision in Article II that requires the president to make recommendations to Congress , but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations .","2892":"Typically , these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market-oriented alternatives to regulations . Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's Office of Management and Budget from subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost-benefit scrutiny . There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other .","2893":"Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal 1990 better illustrates Congress 's attempt to usurp executive power than Section 609 of the executive-office bill : `` None of the funds made available pursuant to the provisions of this Act shall be used to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which has been disapproved pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted in accordance with the applicable law of the United States . ''","2894":"This provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law , since a one-house resolution could be said to be `` duly adopted '' even though it would require neither bicameral action in Congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto . The Supreme Court 's decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .","2895":"< President Bush__Bush:PERSON > should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to discharge his duties and exercise his prerogatives . If < President Bush__Bush:PERSON > fails to do so in < his__Bush:PERSON > first year , < he__Bush:PERSON > will invite Congress , for the remainder of < his__Bush:PERSON > presidency , to rewrite Article II of the Constitution to suit its purposes . What becomes custom in the < Bush__Bush:PERSON > administration will only become more difficult for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo .","2896":"< President Reagan__Reagan:PERSON > learned that lesson . By 1987 , then-Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president , through an appropriations rider , to treat the Soviets as though the Senate had ratified SALT II .","2897":"If a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded , the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and assert a power of excision , declaring the rider restricting his Article II powers to be unconstitutional and severable . The Constitution does not expressly give the president such power . However , the president does have a duty not to violate the Constitution . The question is whether his only means of defense is the veto .","2898":"Excision of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and prerogative under Article II would be different from the line-item veto . As discussed in the context of controlling federal spending , the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are objectionable merely because they conflict with his policy objectives . The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability . One could argue that it is not an assertion of a item veto at all for the president , by exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers .","2899":"There is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills . If Congress does nothing , < President Bush__Bush:PERSON > will have won . If Congress takes the dispute to the Supreme Court -LRB- assuming it can establish standing to sue -RRB- , < President Bush__Bush:PERSON > might win . In that case , < he__Bush:PERSON > might receive an opinion from the court that is a vindication of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the framers thought should be entrusted to the executive .","2900":"If < President Bush__Bush:PERSON > loses at the court , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was for the < Reagan__Reagan:PERSON > administration . But the presidency would be no worse off than it is now . Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice .","2901":"As it stands now , Congress presumes after the < Reagan__Reagan:PERSON > administration that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down . < President Bush__Bush:PERSON > should set things straight . If < he__Bush:PERSON > does not , < he__Bush:PERSON > will help realize < Madison 's__Madison:PERSON > fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''","2902":"Mr. Sidak served as an attorney in the < Reagan__Reagan:PERSON > administration . His longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year .","2903":"Despite one of the most devastating droughts on record , net cash income in the Farm Belt rose to a new high of $ 59.9 billion last year .","2904":"The previous record was $ 57.7 billion in 1987 , according to the Agriculture Department .","2905":"Net cash income -- the amount left in farmers ' pockets after deducting expenses from gross cash income -- increased in 33 states in 1988 , as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices , the department 's Economic Research Service reported yesterday . Most of those states set farm income records .","2906":"The worst crop damage occurred in the Midwestern Corn Belt and the northern Great Plains . What saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had `` mortgaged '' to the government under price-support loan programs . With prices soaring , they were able to sell the reclaimed commodities at `` considerable profit , '' the agency 's 240-page report said .","2907":"In less parched areas , meanwhile , farmers who had little or no loss of production profited greatly from the higher prices .","2908":"To the surprise of some analysts , net cash income rose in some of the hardest-hit states , including Indiana , Illinois , Nebraska and the Dakotas . Analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ 4 billion disaster-assistance package enacted by Congress .","2909":"Last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s . It also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm lobbies and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the 1985 farm program next year .","2910":"Commodity prices have been rising in recent years , with the farm price index hitting record peaks earlier this year , as the government curtailed production with land-idling programs to reduce price-depressing surpluses . At the same time , export demand for U.S. wheat , corn and other commodities strengthened , said < Keith Collins__Keith Collins:PERSON > , < a department analyst__Keith Collins:PERSON > . Farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices , as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low .","2911":"`` All of these forces came together in 1988 to benefit agriculture , '' < Mr. Collins__Keith Collins:PERSON > said .","2912":"California led the nation with $ 6.5 billion in net cash income last year , followed by Texas , $ 3.9 billion ; Iowa , $ 3.4 billion ; Florida , $ 3.1 billion ; and Minnesota , $ 2.7 billion . Iowa and Minnesota were among the few major farm states to log a decline in net cash income .","2913":"Despite federal disaster relief , the drought of 1988 was a severe financial setback for an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 farmers , according to the department . Many lost their farms .","2914":"Department economists do n't expect 1989 to be as good a year as 1988 was . Indeed , net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline . At the same time , an increase of land under cultivation after the drought has boosted production of corn , soybeans and other commodities , causing a fall in prices that has been only partly cushioned by heavy grain buying by the Soviets .","2915":"Last year , government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ 14.5 billion from a record $ 16.7 billion in 1987 . Payments are expected to range between $ 9 billion and $ 12 billion this year .","2916":"After years of struggling , the Los Angeles Herald Examiner will publish its last edition today , shut down by its parent , < Hearst Corp.__William Randolph Hearst:PERSON > , following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper .","2917":"The demise of the 238,000-circulation Herald , once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding 700,000 , turns the country 's second-largest city into a one-newspaper town , at least in some senses .

But it faces stiff competition in Orange County from the Orange County Register , which sells more than 300,000 copies a day , and in the San Fernando Valley from the Los Angeles Daily News , which sells more than 170,000 . Nearby cities such as Pasadena and Long Beach also have large dailies .","2918":"In July , < closely held Hearst__William Randolph Hearst:PERSON > , based in New York , put the paper on the block .

Los Angeles is a sprawling , balkanized newspaper market , and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the mammoth Times , then target a particular area with one of the regional dailies .

American Express also represents the upscale image `` we 're trying to project , '' she adds .","2938":"Buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as `` the doctor 's car '' -- a product for upscale professionals . Sales were roughly flat in the 1989 model year compared with a year earlier , though industry sales fell .

Some 3.8 million of the five million who will get letters were preapproved for credit with GMAC .

An appeal is expected .","2952":"In response to the ruling , gilt futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session .

At one point , Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 % of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings .","2954":"When two parties engage in an interest-rate swap , they are betting against each other on future rates . Thus , an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments .

The real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards . Program trading itself , according to many academics who have studied it , is merely caught in the middle of this battle , unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace . The evidence indicates that program trading did n't , in fact , cause the market 's sharp fall on Oct. 13 , though it may have exacerbated it .","2964":"On one side of this power struggle stand the forces in ascendency on Wall Street -- the New Guard -- consisting of high-tech computer wizards at the major brokerage firms , their pension fund clients with immense pools of money , and the traders at the fast-growing Chicago futures exchanges . These are the main proponents of program trading .","2965":"Defending their ramparts are Wall Street 's Old Guard -- the traditional , stock-picking money managers , tens of thousands of stock brokers , the New York Stock Exchange 's listed companies and the clannish floor traders , known as specialists , who make markets in their stocks .","2966":"So far , Wall Street 's Old Guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle , successfully mobilizing public and congressional opinion to bludgeon their tormentors .","2967":"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange , a major futures marketplace , yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market , and the Big Board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading .","2968":"Stung by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a gigantic crapshoot , almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage , a common form of program trading , for their own accounts in the past few days . A few , such as giant Merrill Lynch & Co. , now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients .","2969":"The Old Guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based , in part because some Old Guard members feel their very livelihood is at stake . Some , such as traditional money manager Neuberger & Berman , have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators `` stop the numbers racket on Wall Street .

Its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable . Program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country , and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has wedded them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them . What 's more , the last time major Wall Street firms said they were getting out of program trading -- in the aftermath of the 1987 crash -- they waited a few months and then sneaked back into it .","2973":"Even some members of the Old Guard , despite their current advantage , seem to be conceding that the future belongs with the New Guard .

At Kidder , a unit of General Electric Co. , and other big brokerage firms , stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away . Corporations like Contel denounce program trading , yet Contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like Bankers Trust Co. that are also big program traders .","2976":"The Big Board -- the nation 's premier stock exchange -- is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives . Its entrenched 49 stock specialists firms are fighting tooth and nail against programs . But the Big Board 's leadership -- over the specialists ' protests -- two weeks ago began trading a new stock `` basket '' product designed to facilitate program trading . `` A lot of people would like to go back to 1970 , '' before program trading , < Mr. Phelan__John Phelan:PERSON > said this week . `` < I__John Phelan:PERSON > would like to go back to 1970 . But we are not going back to 1970 . ''","2977":"Again and again , program-trading 's critics raise the `` casino '' theme . They say greedy market manipulators have made a shambles of the nation 's free-enterprise system , turning the stock market into a big gambling den , with the odds heavily stacked against the small investor . `` The public did n't come to the market to play a game ; they can go to Off-Track Betting for that , '' says < A. Brean Murray__A. Brean Murray:PERSON > , chairman of Brean Murray , Foster Securities , a traditional money management firm .","2978":"The program traders , on the other hand , portray old-fashioned stock pickers as the Neanderthals of the industry .

''","2979":"For all the furor , there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage , the most controversial type of computer-assisted program trading . Like other forms of arbitrage , it merely seeks to take advantage of momentary discrepancies in the price of a single product -- in this case , a basket of stocks -- in different markets -- in this case the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago futures markets .","2980":"That divergence is what stock index traders seek . When it occurs , the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks -LRB- such as the 500 stocks that constitute the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index -RRB- in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market ; they lock in the difference in price as profit .","2981":"Such program trades , which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock , occur in a matter of seconds . A program trade of $ 5 million of stock typically earns a razor-thin profit of $ 25,000 . To keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives , traders must seize every opportunity their computers find .","2982":"The speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics profess to despise . `` If < you__J.

Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares , takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , dumped every blue-chip stock they had . While program trades swiftly kicked in , a `` circuit breaker '' that halted trading in stock futures in Chicago made some program trading impossible . < Susan Del Signore__Susan Del Signore:PERSON > , < head trader at Travelers Investment Management Co.__Susan Del Signore:PERSON > , says critics are ignoring `` the role the -LCB- takeover stock -RCB- speculator is taking in the market as a source of volatility . '' Many arbs are `` overleveraged , '' she says , and they `` have to sell when things look like they fall apart . ''","2985":"Like virtually everything on Wall Street , the program-trading battle is over money , and the traditionalists have been losing out on bundles of it to the New Guard in recent years . Take the traditional money managers , or `` stock pickers , '' as they are derisively known among the computer jockeys . Traditional stock managers like to charge 50 cents to 75 cents for every $ 100 they manage for big institutional investors , and higher fees for smaller investors . Yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with , much less beat , the returns of standard benchmarks like the S&P Not surprisingly , old-style money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to juggle portfolios so they mirror the S&P 500 .","2986":"The indexers charge only a few pennies per $ 100 managed . Today , about $ 200 billion , or 20 % of all pension-fund stock investments , is held by index funds .","2987":"The new Wall Street of computers and automated trading threatens to make dinosaurs of the 49 Big Board stock-specialist firms . These small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of 30 % to 40 % a year on their capital , by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks . The specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death knell .","2988":"And they believe the Big Board , under < Mr. Phelan__John Phelan:PERSON > , has abandoned their interest . The son of a specialist and once one himself , < Mr. Phelan__John Phelan:PERSON > has nonetheless been striving -- with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much -- to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets .","2989":"Meanwhile , specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility . `` When the sell programs hit , you can hear the order printers start to go '' on the Big Board trading floor , says one specialist there . `` The buyers walk away , and the specialist is left alone '' as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks , he contends .","2990":"No one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers . They are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the 1987 stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then . `` Small investors are absolutely dismayed that Wall Street is stacking the deck against them , and these wide swings are scaring them to death , '' says < Raymond A. Mason , chairman of regional broker Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore__Raymond A. Mason:PERSON > . Stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling .

Among the top practitioners were Wall Street blue bloods : Morgan Stanley & Co. , Kidder Peabody , Merrill Lynch , Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Group Inc. . But then came Oct. 13 and the negative publicity orchestrated by the Old Guard , particularly against index arbitrage . The indexers ' strategy for the moment is to hunker down and let the furor die . `` There 's a lynch-mob psychology right now , '' says the top program-trading official at a Wall Street firm . `` Wall Street 's cash cow has been gored , but I do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem . ''","2993":"Too much money is at stake for program traders to give up . For example , stock-index futures began trading in Chicago in 1982 , and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched . Stock futures trading has minted dozens of millionaires in their 20s and 30s . Now , on a good day , Chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the Big Board trades in stock .","2994":"Now the stage is set for the battle to play out . The anti-programmers are getting some helpful thunder from Congress . Program traders ' `` power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way , '' says Rep. Edward Markey , a Massachusetts Democrat . `` We have to have a system that says to those largest investors : ` Sit down ! You will not panic , you will not put the financial system in jeopardy . ' ''","2995":"But the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon . Many people , including the Big Board , think that it 's too late to put the genie back in the bottle . The Big Board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions , but a total ban is n't being considered , Big Board officials say .","2996":"`` You 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks , '' says Vanderbilt 's Prof. Stoll . `` Program trading is here to stay , and computers are here to stay , and we just need to understand it . ''","2997":"Short of a total ban , some anti-programmers have proposed several middle-ground reforms , which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't .","2998":"One such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement -- or the `` good-faith '' payment of cash needed to trade them -- to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks . Currently , margins on stock futures purchases are much lower -- roughly 7 % compared with 50 % for stocks -- making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative . Program trading critics also want the Federal Reserve Board , rather than the futures industry , to set such margins .","2999":"Futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active . Higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell , they say .","3000":"Another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an `` uptick rule `` a reform instituted after the Great Crash of 1929 that protects against stocks being relentlessly beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices , namely short sellers . The Big Board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price .","3001":"But in 1986 , program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations , to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets . A reinstatement of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably . Program traders argue that a reinstatement of the rule would destroy the `` pricing efficiency '' of the futures and stock markets .","3002":"James A. White contributed to this article .","3003":"Fundamentalists Jihad . < START Big Board Chairman John Phelan__John Phelan:PERSON > said yesterday that < he__John Phelan:PERSON > could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild stock-price swings .","3004":"Thus the band-wagon psychology of recent days picks up new impetus .","3005":"Index arbitrage is a common form of program trading . As usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept : Two separate markets in different locations , trading basically the same widgets , ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different . In index arbitrage , the widget is the S&P 500 , and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in Chicago and the stock markets largely in New York . To profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity , someone who owns the S&P 500 widget in New York must sell it and replace it with a cheaper S&P 500 widget in Chicago .","3006":"If the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the S&P 500 index , he is likely to remain fully invested at all times . -LRB- Few , if any , index-fund managers will risk leveraging performance by owning more than 100 % exposure to stocks , and equally few will want to own less than a 100 % position should stocks rise . -RRB-","3007":"By constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget , index-arbitrage traders hope to add between 1 % and 3 % to the annual return of the S&P 500 . That represents a very thin `` excess '' return , certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective . The fact that a vast majority of fundamentalist money managers fail to beat the S&P 500 may contribute to the hysteria surrounding the issue .","3008":"As more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy , these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and , eventually , eliminated . The current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the S&P 500 is more cumbersome than transacting in the futures market . The New York Stock Exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' desires to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares .","3009":"So if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin inefficiencies between two markets for the same widget , how did `` program trading '' evolve into the evil creature that is evoking the curses of so many observers ? All arguments against program trading , even those pressed without fact , conclude with three expected results after `` reforms '' are implemented : 1 -RRB- reduced volatility , 2 -RRB- a long-term investment focus , and 3 -RRB- a level playing field for the small investor . But many of these reforms are unneeded , even harmful .","3010":"Reducing volatility . An index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in New York and Chicago to cover all transaction costs . Arbitrage does n't cause volatility ; it responds to it . Think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for S&P 500 stocks -- usually it is large investors initiating a buy or sell in Chicago .","3011":"A large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures . Arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from Chicago to New York , while functioning as a buyer in Chicago . The start of the whole process is the key-someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in widgets to make widget prices move .","3012":"Why does this large hypothetical seller trade in Chicago instead of New York ? Perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade . In a competitive market , this investor has many ways to execute his transactions , and he will have more alternatives -LRB- both foreign and domestic -RRB- if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle . If not Chicago , then in New York ; if not the U.S. , then overseas .","3013":"Volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage , but because his is a large addition or subtraction to a widget market with finite liquidity . Eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising , creating more volatility instead of less . The speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either , because faster and cleaner execution is desirable , not loathsome . If slowing things down could reduce volatility , stone tablets should become the trade ticket of the future .","3014":"Encouraging long-term investing . We must be very cautious about labeling investors as `` long-term '' or `` short-term . '' Policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are akin to placing a sign over the Big Board 's door saying : `` Buyers welcome , sellers please go away ! '' The ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive , and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term . A free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can tolerate .","3015":"In point of fact , volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today . Periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile , usually when fundamental market conditions were undergoing change -LRB- 1973-75 , 1937-40 , and 1928-33 for example -RRB- . It is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers scream `` foul '' on program trading when the markets decline , while hailing the great values still abounding as the markets rise . Could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks , instead of the evil deeds of program-trading goblins ?","3016":"Some of the proposed fixes for what is labeled `` program-trading volatility '' could be far worse than the perceived problem . In using program trading as a whipping boy , fundamentalist investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing stock-selection products . They may , however , risk bringing some damaging interference from outside the markets themselves . How does a nice new tax , say 5 % , on any financial transaction sound ? That ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term .","3017":"Getting a level playing field . This argument is perhaps the most interesting one for abolishing program trading -- not because of its merits , but because of the firms championing the cause . The loudest of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors . They continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell , while their clients continue to hope for superior performance . Even with mutual funds , the little investor continues to tolerate high fees , high commissions and poor performance , while index-fund managers slowly amass a better record with lower fees , lower commissions and less risk . Yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert studiously devouring press clippings on each company he follows .","3018":"Almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy , and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences .","3019":"If spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous , surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors . The sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue stellar performers first , while leaving institutions to grapple with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter . Cost-effective index funds just are n't sexy enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay , and that institutional customers refuse to pay .","3020":"Each new trading roadblock is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their high-volume clients , here or overseas . Legislating new trading inefficiencies will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors .","3021":"So what is next for program trading ? Left to its own devices , index arbitrage will become more and more efficient , making it harder and harder to do profitably . Spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses -- arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit .","3022":"If government or private watchdogs insist , however , on introducing greater friction between the markets -LRB- limits on price moves , two-tiered execution , higher margin requirements , taxation , etc. -RRB- , the end loser will be the markets themselves . Instead , we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants .","3023":"< Mr. Allen 's__J.

The administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal 1990 as was appropriated in fiscal 1989 .","3030":"The offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act . Under that law , parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ 15 million or more must notify FTC and Justice Department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions . Currently , the government charges nothing for such filings .","3031":"Proponents of the funding arrangement predict that , based on recent filing levels of more than 2,000 a year , the fees will yield at least $ 40 million this fiscal year , or $ 10 million more than the budget cuts . `` When < you__James Rill:PERSON > do that , there is not a cut , but there is in fact a program increase of $ 5 million '' each for the FTC and the Justice Department , Rep.

Whereas conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly , Wall Street 's new penchant for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years .","3117":"`` The recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays '' in getting their money back , says < Jeffrey Bowman__Jeffrey Bowman:PERSON > , < a vice president at S&P__Jeffrey Bowman:PERSON > , which raised a warning flag for the industry in April when it downgraded CS First Boston .","3118":"`` Wall Street is facing a Catch-22 situation , '' says Mr. Mahoney of Moody 's . Merchant banking , where firms commit their own money , `` is getting riskier , and there 's less of it to go around . '' In addition , he says , the buy-out business is under pressure `` because of the junk bond collapse , '' meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings shrinks .","3119":"In a leveraged buy-out , a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing , with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets .","3120":"In a recent report , Moody 's said it `` expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry , which , combined with overcapacity , will create poor prospects for profitability . '' It said that the `` temptation for managements to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor . ''","3121":"Both Moody 's and S&P cited First Boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking , which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit . The recent cash squeeze at Campeau Corp. , First Boston 's most lucrative client of the decade , is proving costly to First Boston because it arranged more than $ 3 billion of high-yield , high-risk junk financings for Campeau units . In addition , a big loan that First Boston made to Ohio Mattress Co. was n't repaid on time when its $ 450 million junk financing for a buy-out of the bedding company was withdrawn .","3122":"`` These two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of CS First Boston 's equity , '' Moody 's said . `` Total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity . '' CS First Boston , however , benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder , Credit Suisse , Switzerland 's third largest bank .","3123":"Shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business . But its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail , or individual investor , business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the October 1987 stock market crash . In addition , Shearson 's listed $ 2 billion of capital is overstated , according to the rating concerns , because it includes $ 1.7 billion of goodwill . Shearson `` really only has $ 300 million of capital , '' says Mr. Bowman of S&P .","3124":"A Shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried . `` A year ago , Moody 's also had Shearson under review for possible downgrade , '' he said . `` After two months of talks , our rating was maintained . '' Drexel , meanwhile , already competes at a disadvantage to its big Wall Street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating .","3125":"The collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held Drexel , the leading underwriter in that market . The firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six felonies related to a big insider-trading scandal . Drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business , cutting the firm 's workforce almost in half to just over 5,000 .","3126":"Recently , Drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years . The firm 's capital , moreover , has n't grown at the same rate as in the past , officials at these firms say .","3127":"Drexel remains confident of its future creditworthiness . `` We 're well positioned with $ 1.7 billion of capital , '' a Drexel spokesman said . `` And as a leading investment and merchant banking firm , the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and vicissitudes of the retail business is a major plus in our view . Moreover , we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the Street in reducing costs , which are down around 40 % over the last six months . ''","3128":"< Lewis C. Veraldi__Lewis C.

We can understand and share the compassion that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of Solomonic aid to those who 've been hurt . But this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional policy-making process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk , technology and innovation . Too often now , a single court decision becomes the precedent for other , less compelling cases .","3133":"From the 1940s until 1971 , some two million women took the synthetic hormone diethylstilbestrol -LRB- DES -RRB- to prevent miscarriages and morning sickness . The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and marketed by some 300 pharmaceutical companies , often under generic labels . In the 1970s , scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of DES users .","3134":"The cases quickly went to court , but the mothers of several thousand DES plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used . Beginning in 1980 , courts in several states including California and New York decided to suspend the common-law rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable . Courts made the assumption that all DES pills were essentially the same , and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales .","3135":"This has some logic . Drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used . But courts quickly tumbled down a slippery slope . Just as all plaintiffs are not alike , it turns out that DES defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different warranties . The ultimate result came in < Hymowitz__Mindy Hymowitz:PERSON > v. Lilly , where the highest New York court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove Mindy Hymowitz 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages .","3136":"But as Duke University law professor William Van Alstyne notes , by this reasoning a defendant could be held liable in New York for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in California . Despite the Supreme Court 's refusal to hear the case , there are serious constitutional issues of due process and uncompensated takings from the defendants . The big problem , however , is that there 's no guarantee that this reasoning will be limited to DES or to drugs .","3137":"The problem here goes well beyond twisting legal doctrine . The California Supreme Court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win DES cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has chilled the introduction of new drugs . The court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs , citing the huge , hidden social costs . `` Public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs , even though some risks , perhaps serious ones , might accompany their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering , '' the unanimous court said . The California justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining anti-morning-sickness drug , Bendectin , off the U.S. market .","3138":"This raises the key issue : What to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs ? We now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone . As liability expert Peter Huber tells us , after the < Hymowitz__Mindy Hymowitz:PERSON > case , if any drug maker introduces an anti-miscarriage drug `` it 's time to sell that company 's stock short . '' We also know that the tort system is a lousy way to compensate victims anyway ; some win the legal lottery , others get much less and contingency-fee lawyers take a big cut either way .","3139":"DES daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts . Congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs . But a 1986 law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's vaccines with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation .","3140":"Everyone by now understands that Congress is utterly incapable of writing legislation to help deserving people without its becoming some billion-dollar morass . We have no doubt this is one reason judges in New York and justices on the Supreme Court are willing to trash the law in the DES cases . They must figure that justice has to get done by somebody , but know it wo n't be done by Congress .","3141":"Odyssey Partners Limited Partnership , an investment firm , completed the purchase of May Department Stores Co.

Although started in 1965 , Wedtech did n't really get rolling until 1975 , when < Mr. Neuberger__Fred Neuberger:PERSON > discovered the federal government 's Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- minority business program . This is a Johnson-era , Great Society creation that mandates certain government contracts be awarded noncompetitively to minority businesses . < Mr. Neuberger__Fred Neuberger:PERSON > realized that , although of Italian ancestry , < Mr. Mariotta__John Mariotta:PERSON > still could qualify as a minority person since < he__John Mariotta:PERSON > was born in Puerto Rico .

They do at least come around to saying that the courts might want to end `` rigid affirmative action programs . '' Programs like Section 8 -LRB- A -RRB- are a little like leaving gold in the street and then expressing surprise when thieves walk by to scoop it up . Numerous other scandals , among them the ones at HUD , have the same characteristics as Wedtech . They take place in government programs that seem tailor-made for corruption .","3555":"Why are programs like this not eliminated ? `` Feeding Frenzy '' does provide a few clues . In and around all levels of government in the U.S. are groups of people who can best be described as belonging to a political insider commercial party . They know that whenever government is redistributing wealth , regulating commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment , there is big money to be made in influencing , brokering or selling the processes and decisions of government . They are our version of the East bloc 's Nomenklatura and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change .

Sales in the latest period were $ 1.76 billion , a 13 % increase from last year 's $ 1.55 billion .","3572":"For the year ended Sept. 30 , Ralston earned $ 422.5 million , or $ 6.44 a share , up 8.9 % from $ 387.8 million , or $ 5.63 a share . This year 's results included a gain of $ 70.2 million on the disposal of seafood operations . Sales for the full year were $ 6.6 billion , up 13 % from $ 5.8 billion .","3573":"Ralston said its restructuring costs include the phase-out of a battery facility in Greenville , N.C. , the recent closing of a Hostess cake bakery in Cincinnati and a reduction in staff throughout the company . The battery plant , which makes rechargeable nickel cadmium and carbon zinc products , will be closed over the next year or so , a spokesman said .","3574":"Ralston attributed its fourth-quarter slump partly to higher costs of ingredients in the pet food business as well as competitive pressures , which required higher advertising spending . For the year , pet food volume was flat , the company said .","3575":"Its cereal division realized higher operating profit on volume increases , but also spent more on promotion . The Continental Baking business benefited from higher margins on bread and on increased cake sales , it added .","3576":"Ralston said its Eveready battery unit was hurt by continuing economic problems in South America .","3577":"Ralston shares closed yesterday at $ 80.50 , off $ 1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .","3578":"Companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . The companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . Estimated and actual results involving losses are omitted .","3579":"The percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . Otherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate .","3580":"Source : Zacks Investment Research","3581":"First Chicago Corp. said it completed its $ 55.1 million cash-and-stock acquisition of closely held Ravenswood Financial Corp. , another Chicago bank holding company .","3582":"The record corn-buying binge by the Soviet Union is causing serious bottlenecks in the U.S. grain pipeline .","3583":"The Soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river barges and trains to move the recently harvested Midwest crop to ports for loading onto Soviet ships .","3584":"River barge rates have soared 40 % this fall from a year earlier . Railroad companies and some ports are reaping a sudden windfall of business . And some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might gyrate this month as exporters scrounge to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the Soviets .","3585":"The Soviet Union bought roughly 310 million bushels of U.S. corn in October , which is the most ever sold to the Soviet Union in one month from the U.S. . The Soviet Union wants much of it delivered by January , which would be a strain in most years .","3586":"But it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the Mississippi River , on which flows much of the U.S. corn that is shipped overseas .","3587":"`` We are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record , '' said < William Dunton__William Dunton:PERSON > , < a U.S. Agriculture Department transportation expert__William Dunton:PERSON > . `` It is going to be real tight . ''","3588":"Because of persistent dry weather in the northern Plains , the water level on the upper section of the Mississippi River is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of barges their tows push at one time .","3589":"In a few weeks , many barges probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of St. Louis because the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the Missouri River , which feeds into the Mississippi River . The Army Corps is cutting the flow of the Missouri River about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the reservoirs that feed it .","3590":"Barge rates on the Mississippi River sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the Midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation .","3591":"But the Army Corps of Engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month . At St. Louis , the water level of the Mississippi River is already 6.5 feet below normal and it could drop an additional 2.5 feet when the flow of the Missouri River is slowed , an Army Corps spokesman said . Similar levels hamstrung barge shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in 50 years .","3592":"So far , the grain industry 's budding logistical problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade . Many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers .","3593":"At the Board of Trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for December delivery slipped 3.5 cents a bushel to settle at $ 2.375 a bushel .","3594":"Corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge Soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the stockpiles depleted by the 1988 drought . With the harvest winding down , however , some analysts are speculating that prices might jump in some regions as U.S. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver .","3595":"Farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices . Because the drought reduced U.S. stockpiles , they have more than enough storage space for their new crop , and that permits them to wait for prices to rise .","3596":"In parts of Iowa , for example , some grain elevators are offering farmers $ 2.15 a bushel for corn . Many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least 20 cents a bushel , said < Lyle Reed__Lyle Reed:PERSON > , < president of Chicago Central & Pacific Railroad Co. of Waterloo , Iowa__Lyle Reed:PERSON > .","3597":"It is n't clear , however , who would win a waiting game . Although U.S. corn stockpiles shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought , the Agriculture Department projects that nearly one-fifth of the harvest will still be in storage before the 1990 corn harvest begins .","3598":"Some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts -- only to see little appreciation . `` The public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped , '' said Bill Biedermann , Allendale Inc. research director .","3599":"Although much of this country 's export corn goes to New Orleans by barge , it is possible for exporters to sidestep the Mississippi River by shipping a larger-than-normal amount of corn by train to the port .","3600":"Ports in the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast can also relieve pressure on New Orleans . One railroad , for example , is already increasing its grain hauling service from Indiana to Baltimore .","3601":"And it is n't clear that the Soviet Union will stay on its record buying pace . The Soviet orders were compressed into the month of October because of delays . The Soviet Union usually begins buying U.S. crops earlier in the fall . But its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems .","3602":"In other commodity markets yesterday : ENERGY : Crude oil futures prices increased in moderate trading , but much of the action was in heating oil .","3603":"Prices rose on the news that a sizable West German refinery was damaged in a fire , tightening an already tight European market . Heating oil for November delivery ended at 58.64 cents a gallon , up one cent on the New York Mercantile Exchange . West Texas Intermediate for December delivery advanced 22 cents to $ 19.94 a barrel . Gasoline futures continued a sell-off that began Monday .","3604":"PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices eased as increased stability and strength came into the securities markets . December delivery gold fell $ 3.20 an ounce to $ 377.60 . December silver declined 6.50 cents an ounce to $ 5.2180 . January platinum was down $ 5.70 an ounce at $ 494.50 . Precious metals , gold in particular , currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability , according to < William O'Neill__William O'Neill:PERSON > , < vice president of research at Elders Futures in New York__William O'Neill:PERSON > . `` The recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities , '' < he__William O'Neill:PERSON > said . Yesterday , the stock market rose strongly , creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders , < he__William O'Neill:PERSON > said . Silver and platinum , which have more of an industrial nature than gold , were even weaker , < he__William O'Neill:PERSON > said . Silver is also under pressure of `` extremely high '' inventories in warehouses of the Commodity Exchange , < he__William O'Neill:PERSON > said . Yesterday , these stocks rose by 170,262 ounces to a record of 226,570,380 ounces , according to an exchange spokesman .","3605":"COPPER : Futures prices partially recovered Monday 's declines because Chilean miners voted to strike . The December contract rose 1.20 cents a pound to $ 1.14 . In Chile , workers at two copper mines , Los Bronces and El Soldado , which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputada , yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow , an analyst said . Reasons for the walkout , the analyst said , included a number of procedural issues , such as a right to strike . The analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks . In the case of copper , he said , the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal . Also contributing to the firmness in copper , the analyst noted , was a report by Chicago purchasing agents , which precedes the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold . The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago 's October index rose to 51.6 % after three previous months of readings below 50 % . The September index was 47.1 % . A reading below 50 % generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy , while a reading above 50 % points to expansion . The Chicago report raised the possibility that the October survey of the National Association of Purchasing Management would also show a reading above 50 % .","3606":"NCR Corp. unveiled two models of its Tower line of midrange computers and introduced advanced networking software to allow the Tower family to operate as a central hub in a network of computers .","3607":"The new software is based on Novell Inc. 's NetWare network operating system software .","3608":"USX Corp. posted a 23 % drop in third-quarter profit , as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations .","3609":"The nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ 175 million , or 62 cents a share , compared with the year-earlier $ 228 million , or 80 cents a share . The recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ 98 million from asset sales , while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ 61 million . In the 1988 period , USX also had a $ 71 million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement . Sales rose 5 % to $ 4.4 billion from $ 4.2 billion .","3610":"The earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter , when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing . However , third-quarter operating profit fell 14 % , as USX sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments , eliminating income from those operations .","3611":"Among segments that continue to operate , though , the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its tubular goods serving the oil industry and other markets . < Peter Marcus__Peter Marcus:PERSON > , < an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.__Peter Marcus:PERSON > , said that a downturn in the appliance industry , coupled with sluggish automotive sales , hurt USX results . Moreover , USX exports more than other steelmakers , and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure .","3612":"The company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the Lorain , Ohio , plant , which now is a 50-50 joint venture with Japan 's Kobe Steel Ltd. .","3613":"In the steel division , operating profit dropped 11 % to $ 85 million . Profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ 33 a ton from $ 42 a ton last year and $ 53 a ton in the second quarter , analysts said . Still , USX fared better than other major steelmakers , earning more per ton of steel shipped than either Bethlehem Steel Corp. , which posted a 54 % drop in net income , or Inland Steel Industries Inc. , whose profit plummeted 70 % .","3614":"In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , USX shares closed up $ 1.25 , at $ 34.625 , as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales . The rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that USX 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' .","3615":"< Charles Bradford__Charles Bradford:PERSON > , < an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets__Charles Bradford:PERSON > , said USX may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year . < He__Charles Bradford:PERSON > said USX also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products , such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet , than lower-priced structural goods .","3616":"The energy segment , with a 15 % rise in operating profit , is clearly the company 's strongest . Higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the Marathon Oil Co. unit to $ 198 million from $ 180 million . The Texas Oil & Gas division continues to operate in the red , although losses narrowed to $ 9 million from $ 15 million . USX announced in October that it was soliciting bids to sell TXO 's oil and gas reserves .","3617":"Proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares . The company noted that it has reduced debt by $ 1.6 billion since the end of 1988 and bought back about 15.5 million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of 1987 . USX has about $ 5.5 billion in long-term debt and 257 million shares outstanding .","3618":"The announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor Carl Icahn had increased his stake in USX to 13.1 % and threatened a takeover or other business combination . Mr. Icahn has said he believes USX would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments .","3619":"Profit for the nine months jumped 21 % to $ 721 million , or $ 2.62 a share , from $ 598 million , or $ 2.07 a share . Sales rose 10 % to $ 13.8 billion from $ 12.5 billion .","3620":"John F. Barrett , 40 , formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer , was named president and chief operating officer , posts which had been vacant .","3621":"Leon J.

Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure . A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a line-item veto to provoke a test case .","3626":"But the two legal experts , responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy -LRB- D. , Mass. -RRB- , wrote in a joint letter that the president `` lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto . '' The two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum -- Mr. Kurland is a conservative and Mr. Tribe is a liberal .","3627":"The two professors said the Constitution authorizes the president to veto entire bills , not partial measures . Moreover , they said the first appropriations bill passed 200 years ago covered many different items , and there was no discussion of a line-item veto . They also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the Civil War , and `` all have shared the view that such lawmaking power is beyond the reach '' of the president .","3628":"Sen. Kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power , but that it would be a `` reckless course of action '' for President Bush to claim the authority without congressional approval .","3629":"Trinity Industries Inc. said it reached a preliminary agreement to sell 500 railcar platforms to Trailer Train Co. of Chicago .
