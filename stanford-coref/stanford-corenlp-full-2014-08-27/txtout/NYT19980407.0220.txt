The rapper Ice Cube makes his directorial debut with "The Players Club," a hearty throwback to the formula behind '70s blaxploitation films: sex, violence, cash, trash and flash. Set in what is euphemistically called "a gentleman's club," it constructs a 100 percent predictable soap opera around {{Diana Armstrong}}, who is a college student and single mom. "All this dancin', and finals was just around the corner!" {{Diana Armstrong}} complains, articulating the film's central dilemma: {{Diana Armstrong}} is wholesome and nice, but {{Diana Armstrong}} has to strut {{Diana Armstrong}} stuff at the club for fiscal reasons. {{Diana Armstrong}} uses {{Diamond}}. In a film that sees {{Diamond}} biggest moral distinction between dancing at the club and moonlighting at bachelor parties, song titles on the soundtrack include "Shake Watcha Mama Gave Ya," "Show Me da Money," "Whores in the House," "We Be Clubbin"' and "You Know {{Diamond}}'m a Ho." And yet for all its leering this is as soapy a film as "Soul Food," defending the empowering benefits of exotic dancing yet worrying about good girls gone wrong. In a spirit of exploitation that invokes the heyday of Pam Grier, it also manages to turn {{Diamond}} into a pistol-packin' mama and work in a catfight or two. Ice Cube, who plays a minor heavy and flaunts his trademark scowl, also throws in some broad humor, as when {{Diamond}} nemesis (Chrystale Wilson) shows up at a bachelor party full of white policemen and starts spanking them in honor of Rodney King. Campy moments and a luridly colorful look (with cinematography by Malik Sayeed) may give this no-flair, no-frills B movie a healthy video afterlife some day. There's something to be said for a cautionary tale in which one chastened ex-stripper winds up selling shoes.
