NEW YORK _ The day after his production of "Lohengrin" received a hostile reception at the Metropolitan Opera, {{Robert Wilson}}, with commitments to keep, flew to Europe. On the telephone from Geneva, the director expressed his surprise at the reaction, and tried to explain the reason behind it. "With {{Wagner}}, there is a society that's very closed," he said. "They regard 'Lohengrin' as 19th-century romanticism and want to guard it." {{Wagner}} made it clear that {{Wagner}} considered Wagnerians a distinct breed of classicists, rigid in their overprotectiveness. Following that opening-night performance last week, the audience enthusiastically applauded each of the leading singers and {{James Levine}}, who had conducted the orchestra. Then {{James Levine}} brought {{Robert Wilson}} onstage, and there was a sudden, loud chorus of boos, echoing through the opera house. Those who were applauding clapped harder, and there were a few lonely bravos. But the jeers resoundingly outnumbered the cheers. At a second round of bows, the response was the same. For the third round, {{Robert Wilson}} brought {{Frida Parmeggiani}}, {{Frida Parmeggiani}}, forward with {{Robert Wilson}} (possibly to shield {{Robert Wilson}} from the naysayers). In {{Robert Wilson}} long international career as an innovative director of theater and opera, {{Robert Wilson}} has always stirred the strongest reactions. Especially in Europe, {{Robert Wilson}} is regarded as an icon of experimental theater, greeted with appreciative cries of "Bobwilson." {{Robert Wilson}} is certainly accustomed to criticism, in public and in print, but the Met reception was excessive and extraordinarily rude. It was as if {{Robert Wilson}} had committed a crime against the audience. {{Robert Wilson}} said that standing on the stage, struck by a wave of derision, {{Robert Wilson}} thought, "Wow!" wondering what had provoked such a visceral response. As {{Robert Wilson}} said: "{{Robert Wilson}} didn't do anything so radical. {{Robert Wilson}} didn't ask the singers to sing upside down." What {{Robert Wilson}} did was to strip the opera of its romantic trappings and present it in an abstract modern manner, with a minimum of scenery and with lighting used to denote both environment and atmosphere. Behind the singers, a shimmering Rothko -like rectangle changed color according to mood and, in {{Robert Wilson}} signature style, bars of light, both horizontal and vertical, were substituted for traditional woods and palaces. Looking back at the beginning of the project, he said that he had seen a photograph of a production of "Hamlet" in which the ghost was an ordinary man sitting at a desk. He considered the possibility of staging "Lohengrin" in a similar realistic fashion. Then, inspired by {{Wagner}} own drawings, {{Wagner}} began to see the stage space in abstract terms. Searching for the architecture of that space, {{Wagner}} decided to frame the opera with lighting and to present it "in a simple way, so you could concentrate on the music," while knowing that "the simplest line is the most difficult." At the same time, he retained {{Wagner}} wing of a swan as a central motif. Because of the work's mythic elements and outsize emotions, he said, it could easily be made to seem ridiculous: "If I did the opera in an overly theatrical way, that would diminish the music." Remembering other productions, he added, "Often the music is diminished." At all costs, he wanted to help the Met singers feel more comfortable on stage and to give their best performances. "I was trying to be respectful to the text, the story and {{Wagner}}," he said. "One has to pay respect to the master, but one has to be careful not to become a slave." He said that a classic should not be rooted in a single time or place: "This ancient story must be timeless. It must be present, too." <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Whether he is doing {{Wagner}} or Virgil Thomson, he often encounters resistance. He remembered that when he did Richard Strauss ' "Salome" at La Scala in 1987, his diva Montserrat Caballe persuaded him to take a bow with her: "They booed; they bravoed. The booing was less." {{Robert Wilson}} only previous encounter with the Met was in 1986 with "{{Einstein}}," {{Einstein}}. This was not part of the Met repertory but was an independent production paid for by {{Robert Wilson}}. (And {{Robert Wilson}}.) On opening night there were a few walkouts, but those who stayed for the nearly five-hour epic greeted it with a thunderous ovation. With recent shows like "The Black Rider" and "Time Rocker" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, theatergoers attuned to his work arrive with Wilsonian expectations. He said that in contrast to the opera public, theater and particularly dance audiences are able to approach a production as a visual art, to look at it as they might look at a painting. He said that people are accustomed to seeing Shakespeare in all possible situations: updated, undated, deconstructed or even as a monologue, as in {{Robert Wilson}} own one-man performance of "Hamlet." With equanimity, he has also directed imaginative interpretations of plays by {{Ibsen}}, Buechner, Brecht and others. Whether he is doing a new work or a classic, he makes bold artistic choices. Occasionally he indulges in a kind of brinksmanship. At one point in his version of "The Magic Flute" several years ago at the Bastille Opera in Paris, he had a toy ambulance zip across the stage, an antic {{Robert Wilson}} touch. His leading singer objected, giving him the choice of either her or the toy car. In a directorial compromise, the car was eliminated. There were no such anachronisms in his "Lohengrin." With "Lohengrin," the difficulty was in daring to direct a Wagnerian classic at the Met. It seemed apparent that no matter what {{Robert Wilson}} did to {{Wagner}} would have been abhorrent to a large segment of the audience. After the premiere, the controversy continued over the Internet. In {{Robert Wilson}} brief trip to Europe, the director busily immersed {{Robert Wilson}} in two forthcoming projects: a production of {{Ibsen}} "Lady From the Sea" (starring Dominique Sanda) in Milan, Italy, and a workshop of a contemporary opera by Tania Leon in Geneva. {{Robert Wilson}} indicated that {{Robert Wilson}} was undiscouraged by the Met experience. "{{Robert Wilson}} go from one thing to the next, and {{Robert Wilson}} don't think about it," {{Robert Wilson}} said. Or rather, {{Robert Wilson}} was trying not to think about it. Even to such an internationally acclaimed artist like {{Robert Wilson}}, such treatment must be hurtful. He remembered once receiving advice from Diana Vreeland : "Don't worry, Bob. Some years they love {{Robert Wilson}}; some years they hate {{Robert Wilson}}. Just do the work." But would {{Robert Wilson}} do more {{Wagner}}? "Maybe {{Robert Wilson}}'ll do 'The Ring' now," {{Robert Wilson}} said, in full awareness that such an announcement could cause a seismic shudder at the Met. After returning to New York, {{Robert Wilson}} plans to attend the performances of "Lohengrin" Tuesday and Saturday. Asked if {{Robert Wilson}} would appear onstage with the cast at the final curtain, {{Robert Wilson}} offered an emphatic "No!"
