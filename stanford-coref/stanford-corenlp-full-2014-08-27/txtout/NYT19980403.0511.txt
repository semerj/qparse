NEW YORK _ {{Moe Foner}} sat in the glow of sunshine inside {{Moe Foner}} office, where papers, posters and plaques were scattered about. {{Moe Foner}} was on the phone or, more accurately, on hold, waiting for a car-service dispatcher to get back to {{Moe Foner}}. A heart condition and walking pneumonia make it hard for {{Moe Foner}} to get around. "{{Moe Foner}} can't take public transportation," {{Moe Foner}} said, {{Moe Foner}} patience wearing a bit thin. "Oh, {{Moe Foner}}'ll do it some other time." {{Moe Foner}} hung up and rooted around the papers on {{Moe Foner}} desk. "{{Moe Foner}} know about the rally on Saturday?" {{Moe Foner}} asked, holding out a flier plucked from the pile. On it was a picture of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. above the words "We March to Keep His Dream Alive." {{Moe Foner}}, 82, may not be able to do much marching these days, but {{Moe Foner}} does what {{Moe Foner}} can to fulfill the last half of that declaration. For decades {{Moe Foner}} was second in command at 1199, the hospital workers union, witnessing a tumultuous era when it went from representing drugstore clerks and pharmacists to winning collective bargaining rights for thousands of low-paid, behind-the-scenes workers at nonprofit hospitals. In those rocky times, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}e of the labor movement." Today, 30 years after {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was assassinated in Memphis, Tenn., people may recall what the civil-rights leader did for the cause of racial equality. But people like {{Moe Foner}} will never forget what {{Moe Foner}} did for organized labor, a struggle that {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} cast in terms of human rights and dignity. "Some people know very little about {{Martin Luther King Jr.}}," said {{Moe Foner}}, who directs the union's Bread and Roses project, which takes culture to the work place. "{{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was involved with many unions. When {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was shot down in Memphis, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was supporting the sanitation workers, who were on strike. But {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} association with us was special." When the two men met in 1959, the union was trying to organize in seven hospitals, despite the obstacles posed by reluctant managers and laws that excluded employees of nonprofit hospitals from labor laws. "They were at the bottom of the ladder," {{Moe Foner}} recalled. "They received $26 a week and had no protection. Everybody said to us: Don't touch the hospitals. The workers won't stick together because they're poor. Even assuming you get a majority, the hospitals don't have to agree to an election. And if you go on strike, all you'll get is injunctions, jailings and fines." Although the hospital workers were receptive to the union's overtures, {{Moe Foner}} and {{Moe Foner}} colleagues decided they needed to open another front in their campaign. They suspected that organizing low-paid minority workers would not be enough to sway the boards that ran the institutions. "We had to get the public's support, so that could have a moral effect on management," {{Moe Foner}} said. "You're dealing with trustees of hospitals that can call up and speak to the mayor and governor. The Who's Who of America, those people." {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} knew about the union, and {{Moe Foner}} was invited to meet with {{Moe Foner}} at the home of {{Stanley Levison}}, {{Stanley Levison}}. At that meeting, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} offered to write a letter of support which the union widely circulated. By 1962, when the union was lobbying to amend state laws to allow collective bargaining for hospital workers, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} called Gov. Nelson Rockefeller three times to urge {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} support. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} often visited with union members and officials, and {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} last major speech in New York City was at a union rally the month before {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} was killed. In it, {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} boasted that {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} considered {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} "a fellow 1199 -er." {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} mentioned that any talk of urban unrest and "long, hot summers," should also consider what was done during the "long, cold winters" that preceded them. {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} talked about how people worked full-time jobs for part-time pay. "People are always talking about menial labor," {{Martin Luther King Jr.}} told the audience. "But no labor is really menial unless you're not getting adequate wages." Three and a half weeks later, he was dead. The union he helped is now the city's largest, and its headquarters bears his name. Not that {{Moe Foner}} needs any reminders. {{Moe Foner}}'ll be at Saturday's rally, even if walking a block leaves {{Moe Foner}} short of breath. "Labor has to show it's really interested in people," {{Moe Foner}} said. "There are remarkable people around. You shouldn't have to wait until they die to tell them."
