      "3. We use a rule-based chunking algorithm to extract quotation and speaker features from the paragraphs identified by our classifier and choose the most likely answers.\n",
      "4. We use a second rule-based algorithm to associate the identified speakers with their job titles and organizations with regular expressions."
