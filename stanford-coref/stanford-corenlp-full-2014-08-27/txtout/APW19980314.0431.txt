GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Second Army Batallion will be sent to this South American country's Amazonian rainforest to help fight forest fires resulting from an El Nino-fueled drought, the government announced Saturday. Soldiers will join firefighters and Forestry Commission rangers in trying to contain the blazes, which have been burning for a month in the southern and western parts of the country. If the local teams are unable to control the fires, Guyana may look beyond its borders for assistance. "The situation is not so good," said Forestry Minister Satydeo Sawh. "The fires are raging and we may need help." Guyana, on the northeast shoulder of South America, has been suffering a prolonged dry spell, blamed on El Nino-caused changes in the weather pattern, since July. Now, in the height of the dry season, the forests are susceptible to fire and significant rainfall is unlikely before June. The lack of rainfall has already affected such varied industries as rice farming and gold mining. Some of the 35,000 residents of the bauxite mining town of Linden, 70 miles (113 kilometers) south of Georgetown, say the smoke is beginning to affect them. Residents are normally bothered by the dust pollution from the mining.
