WASHINGTON _ Investigators from {{Kenneth Starr}} questioned Monica Lewinsky's mother again Friday but outside the foreboding confines of the grand jury room, according to lawyers close to {{Kenneth Starr}}. The renewed questioning of {{Monica Lewinsky}} mother, {{Marcia Lewis}}, appeared to reflect {{Kenneth Starr}} pledge to press on with {{Kenneth Starr}} investigation of whether {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} had a sexual relationship with {{Monica Lewinsky}}, {{Monica Lewinsky}}, then encouraged {{Marcia Lewis}} and others to lie about it _ accusations that the president has repeatedly denied. At the same time, {{Kenneth Starr}} decision to question {{Marcia Lewis}} away from the grand jury could reflect the prosecutor's desire to avoid a repeat of the public relations disaster of February, when {{Marcia Lewis}} was so unnerved by going before the grand jury that {{Marcia Lewis}} left in a state of near-collapse, generating wide sympathy for {{Marcia Lewis}} and for {{Marcia Lewis}} daughter. {{Kenneth Starr}} office did not return a telephone call seeking comment on the questioning of {{Marcia Lewis}} and about renewed criticism of {{Kenneth Starr}} investigative tactics, including {{Kenneth Starr}} subpoena of bookstore records to determine whether {{Monica Lewinsky}} might have given books as gifts to the president. {{William Ginsburg}}, {{William Ginsburg}}, also declined comment Friday on the latest questioning of {{Marcia Lewis}}. It could not be determined what was asked and whether {{Marcia Lewis}} made any concessions to the prosecutor in return for being spared the ordeal of going before the grand jury again. Friday, the president was still savoring his victory of two days earlier, the dismissal of {{Paula Jones}} sexual-misconduct suit against him, when he was asked on the White House lawn for his reaction to a report that {{Kenneth Starr}} may change {{Kenneth Starr}} whole strategy. According to U.S. News &AMP; World Report, some people in {{Kenneth Starr}} office want the grand jury to indict {{Monica Lewinsky}} and name the president as an unindicted co-conspirator. That way, the findings against {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} would have a public airing in a courtroom, but there would be no need to address the unanswered constitutional issue of whether a sitting president can be indicted. Other aides to {{Kenneth Starr}} favor turning the evidence over to Congress, according to the magazine, which reported on the supposed debate in {{Kenneth Starr}} office on the Internet. Those aides are said to feel that leaving the president's fate to Congress _ assuming there is sufficient evidence to charge him _ would be the best course, even though many political observers doubt that Congress would impeach Clinton in this election year, especially since he is enjoying high ratings in the polls. Asked at a news conference Friday about the article, {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} declined to comment. {{Kenneth Starr}} has been under mounting criticism since a federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., threw out {{Paula Jones}} by {{Paula Jones}}, {{Paula Jones}} accusations {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} has denied. {{Kenneth Starr}} has said that {{Kenneth Starr}} investigation will go on, regardless of the dismissal of {{Paula Jones}}. They are separate matters, although it has often been difficult to tell how separate. {{Kenneth Starr}} began as an investigation into financial dealings of {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} and {{Kenneth Starr}} wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, years ago in Arkansas and has delved in recent months into {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} sexual behavior. The people involved in {{Paula Jones}} and in the episodes that {{Kenneth Starr}} has been studying have occasionally overlapped. {{Kenneth Starr}} was {{Kenneth Starr}} before U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson. {{Kenneth Starr}} has subpoenaed the records of Kramerbooks and Afterwords, an independent store in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood, as well as records from Barnes &AMP; Noble, to review {{Monica Lewinsky}} book purchases of the past two and a half years. That is roughly the time in which {{Monica Lewinsky}} is said to have told friends, including one who taped {{Monica Lewinsky}} phone calls, that {{Monica Lewinsky}} had a relationship with {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}. Friday's hearing dealt only with the Kramerbooks subpoena, and it saw lawyers for {{Monica Lewinsky}} and for Kramerbooks standing in unity. "{{Monica Lewinsky}}'s not been charged with anything," one of Ms. {{Monica Lewinsky}} lawyers, {{Nathaniel Speights}}, said, asserting that {{Nathaniel Speights}} client "has the right to have {{Monica Lewinsky}} privacy protected by this court." "Our ability to read is exactly what the founding fathers had in mind when the Bill of Rights was written," Pamela Bethel, a lawyer for Kramerbooks, argued. But {{Robert Bittman}}, {{Robert Bittman}}, said the grand jury needed the list of purchases {{Monica Lewinsky}} made in order to corroborate other evidence. "{{Kenneth Starr}}'s not {{Kenneth Starr}}, {{Kenneth Starr}}'s {{Kenneth Starr}} that we're looking at," {{Robert Bittman}} said. Ms. Johnson said she would rule in about a week.
