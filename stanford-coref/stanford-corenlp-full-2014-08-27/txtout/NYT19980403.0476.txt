LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ The official position of Doe's Eat Place _ its steakhouse walls boasting notes signed "Bill," thanking the owner for firm campaign support and tender porterhouse _ is immense joy and relief over the dismissal of the {{Paula Jones}} case in a courthouse right near here. The unofficial position, stated by {{Peter Skrivanos}}, contemplating a month or more of tables crowded with tippers on East Coast media expense accounts: "{{Peter Skrivanos}} was going to get a Lexus," {{Peter Skrivanos}} moaned. Reminded by other waiters of the official position, {{Peter Skrivanos}} quickly added that {{Peter Skrivanos}} was joking, and that {{Peter Skrivanos}} Mazda was a fine car. But a minute later, one of those waiters was calculating that {{Peter Skrivanos}} was out at least $1,000. The restaurant manager added that, with plans for emergency shipments of cabernet, she had expected an extra $10,000 a week. From mid- May to the end of June, you see, Little Rock was destined to be more popular than the Hamptons in August. With a lot of the same part-time residents. A news consortium, making plans on the scale of a major party convention, already had nearly 100 members who planned to send 700 journalists, including 115 from NBC alone. For a city of Little Rock's 175,000 population, the boon, now lost, was even beyond the ability of civic boosters to inflate. {{Barry Travis}}, executive director of the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau, estimated $50,000 a day. But that amount would have hardly covered hotel bills, let alone steak and cabernet. By Friday, some Little Rock business people had decided that escaping this onslaught helped compensate for the loss of revenues. Feuds had already broken out here over the intense incubation applied by some hotels to speed up the hatching of their counted chickens. News organizations complained of hotels wanting tens of thousands of dollars in non-refundable fees and deposits to cover minimum-stay requirements of 45 days beginning well before the May 27 trial date. The hotels responded that, especially given the chance that the case wouldn't reach trial, they needed the deposits to make up for reservations they were turning away and wholesale alterations that news organizations demanded. {{Linda Ward}}, general manager of the Legacy Hotel, whooped when {{Linda Ward}} saw the news of the dismissal. Later, stalking {{Linda Ward}} hotel lobby, {{Linda Ward}} addressed those distant journalists who now would not even be arriving. "Go away!" {{Linda Ward}} said, waving {{Linda Ward}} arms as if swatting at a cloud of gnats. Television networks seized on the Legacy, directly across from the courthouse door, as the perfect vantage point for their cameras. But they squawked loudly and publicly when, for each room facing the courthouse, normally going for $95, {{Linda Ward}} proposed charging them $15,000 up front, plus $250 a day. Besides reflecting supply and demand, {{Linda Ward}} said, these expenses covered the networks' plans for remaking the rooms into a stack of broadcast booths. Installation of panoramic, three-fourths-inch tempered glass windows, to be set on a 7-degree slant to reduce glare, would have required a crane. Talks with some news organizations broke down last month. {{Linda Ward}} said that several thousand dollars received in non-refundable deposits won't compensate for business, including Promise Keepers conventioneers, that {{Linda Ward}} lost. "But {{Linda Ward}}'d rather take the hit than take the harassment any day," {{Linda Ward}} said. The Arkansas Excelsior Hotel has received a publicity windfall, of sorts. The networks displayed its soaring brick-and-glass facade whenever they mentioned it as the scene of the president's alleged and unwelcome advances on {{Paula Jones}}. But indoor adventure tourism has its limits. Will a tasteful plaque ever mark the exact room? "I think {{Linda Ward}} know the answer to that," said a hotel executive. Friday, {{Kathy Grayfindley}}, the sales manager, had {{Kathy Grayfindley}} aides hitting the phones, telling frustrated callers from recent months that the city's largest hotel could now, suddenly, make them welcome. {{Kathy Grayfindley}} refused to confirm that the Excelsior was among those that had exacted large deposits. The loss of business extended far beyond the state's borders. The Legacy's new windows had to be ordered from Florida, and the city planned to rent truckloads of crowd barriers from New Orleans, normally much wilder, to contain the throngs outside the courthouse. Many here bemoaned not just the loss of future revenues but also time and money invested. This week, about 30 members of the Little Rock Media Consortium and assisting technicians met to refine plans for remaking the city to their liking. They planned to turn the streets and parking lots in front of the courthouse into Presspass Stadium, with fenced-off interview bullpens and tiered risers for camera crews and photographers. An office building was to become a media center with 1,000 new phone lines and its own deadline-ready, fast-food franchises. Just as the meeting broke up came news of the judge's decision. The protests and groans at the offices of Mrs. Jones ' lawyers couldn't have been louder. "Absolute disappointment," said {{William Headline}}, {{William Headline}}. "We were all revved up. We wanted to see this through to the end." Headline, a former CNN Washington bureau chief, was snatched two days into his retirement to serve as the media's organizer and avuncular go-between with apprehensive local authorities. Friday he was busy closing down his cramped office, at a local television station, while conferring with the court to file and compile all their big plans for handling the media hordes. With Mrs. Jones intending to appeal, and almost three years left in the current administration, that's just in case. "Who knows who else will come out of the woodwork?" Headline said. Not that the city was altogether comfortable with turning tawdry accusations against a former governor and incumbent president into a tourism magnet and economic development tool. "{{Barry Travis}} feel relief that it's not happening," said {{Barry Travis}}. "But if they were going to spend those dollars somewhere, Little Rock is a good place."
