UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Security Council members said Friday the international community must demonstrate the political will to help Africa overcome its economic and social problems. The calls came during an all-day debate on Africa to review Secretary-General Kofi Annan's report last week, in which he outlined goals for the United Nations in assisting the world's most under-developed continent. {{Kofi Annan}}, the first sub-Saharan African to head the United Nations, said that African leaders must be willing to combat corruption, protect human rights and pursue sound economic policies. At the same time, {{Kofi Annan}} said, the international community must respond by investing in Africa and by intervening to end armed conflicts and restore stability. Echoing {{Kofi Annan}} comments, {{Antonio Monteiro}}, {{Antonio Monteiro}}, said "political will is needed from the international community" to help Africa overcome its political problems. "And will and courage is very much needed to avoid future situations in which the United Nations is unfortunately seen to have turned its back on the African people," {{Antonio Monteiro}} said. "Concrete measures should be considered to ensure that the United Nations and the Security Council in particular provide a timely response to impending crises." But the council's willingness to intervene in African crises was weakened by the disastrous failure of the U.N. peacekeeping operation in Somalia. The deaths of 18 American soldiers in a gun battle in 1993 led the United States to withdraw from the Somali operation and impose stringent conditions on future U.N. peacekeeping missions. U.N. officials have complained those conditions have made it nearly impossible for the United Nations to respond quickly to African crises. They point to the U.S. stand as a major reason for the laggard U.N. response to the 1994 massacre of up to 500,000 Rwandan Tutsis and moderate Hutus by Hutu extremists. "The experience of intervention in Somalia was a bitter one but that of non-intervention in Rwanda was perhaps worse," British Ambassador John Weston told the council. He cited the U.N. success in supervising the transition of Eastern Slavonia from Serb to Croat control as an example of how the United Nations could be effective "given the right mandates and resources." The Security Council asked {{Kofi Annan}} to prepare the report following a meeting on Africa held in September. On Wednesday, {{Kofi Annan}} begins a tour of eight African countries _ Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Eritrea.
