BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A judge said the government was being too sensitive when it suspended a math teacher for comparing the size of a coin image of President Bakili Muluzi with that of his predecessor in a class exercise. Blantyre High Court Judge Eric Kumitsonyo said Thursday that he could find "nothing derogatory" in teacher Felix Mchamithe's remark that Muluzi's image on a coin was larger than that of the late dictator Kamuzu Banda. "Is it not true that the face of Muluzi fills the coin? And if it is full, so what?" Kumitsonyo said. Kumitsonyo adjourned the hearing and did not indicate when he will make a ruling. Mchamithe, who asked his pupils to measure the images during a lesson on circumference and circles, sued education authorities for wrongful dismissal. He said he was suspended for allegedly insulting Muluzi and undermining his presidential authority. The teacher told the court that he made it clear in the classroom that Banda, who died last year at age 99, was a small man dwarfed by Muluzi, who is heavily built. Muluzi ousted Banda in the first democratic elections in 1994, ending Banda's brutal 30-year dictatorship. The new ruling party said it would not copy Banda's habit of putting the president's image on the currency, but Muluzi's face appeared there after two years. Detectives spent eight hours Thursday questioning staff at the opposition Daily Times over remarks it published describing Muluzi as "silly," the newspaper reported. The remarks were reportedly made in a speech by an opposition politician who dismissed government accusations that the opposition was sponsoring crime to undermine Muluzi.
