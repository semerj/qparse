The company involved in metal works and production of boilers is expected to be charged soon under section 38 of the Water Supply Act 1997 which carries a maximum fine of RM50,000 or two years ' jail or both. If the company continues stealing water in spite of the directive to stop doing so, it will be fined RM1,000 a day. {{Shah Alam}} district crime chief, Deputy Superintendent G. Selvakumar said police have stepped up their investigations under section 379 of the Penal Code. The company, which has about 400 permanent and contract employees, has been in operation at the site for about two years. {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} today said apart from court action, the State Waterworks Department had been directed to recover payment, estimated to be about half-a million ringgit, from the company. "It is a serious offence to steal water and the company has been doing this from the time it has been in operation at the site with an average of 450,000 litres of water a day," {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} told reporters after opening the 11th Selangor Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry annual general meeting at Radisson Hotel. The courts, {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} added, should also impose deterrent sentences on those charged with theft of water. {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} said the department has also been ordered to act immediately on all information received from the public on theft of water by squatters, individuals and the commercial sector as it could cost the Government millions of ringgit. Asked why the department did not act on complaints lodged by the public earlier on theft of water, {{Selangor Menteri Besar Datuk Abu Hassan Omar}} said he would check with the authorities but assured the public that all complaints would be acted upon effective from today. "The public can also lodge complaints with the State Technical Committee on Water headed by State Secretary {{Datuk Hashim Meon}} or to my office," he added. {{Datuk Hashim Meon}} said the State Government was considering giving rewards to those with information on theft of water. "With the present water crisis, every drop of water counts," {{Datuk Hashim Meon}} said adding that the water rationing exercise was being implemented as planned in all affected areas in Zone A and B. Meanwhile employees at Sun Metal Works Sdn Bhd when interviewed said that the factory had been deprived of water supply for the past two days. Attempts to contact the factory officials proved futile.
