NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC. SIXTY-FIVE of the 69 Commonwealth member countries have confirmed their participation in the 16th Commonwealth Games in September, Deputy Youth and Sports Minister Datuk Loke Yuen Yow told the House. He said this in response to Hashim Ismail (BN - Ledang), who asked whether all the Commonwealth countries would be participating in the Games and whether the Government, in its capacity as host of the second largest international games event, was satisfied with all aspects of the preparations carried out so far. On the athletes' training programme, he said it had entered the fourth phase since early this year. Under this phase, 272 athletes would undergo full-time training schedules. The schedules are supervised by 42 foreign coaches who are assisted by 35 local coaches. He said though in 1992, only badminton salvaged national pride, weight lifting, shooting, gymnastics and bowling are expected to bring Malaysia medals this year. To a supplementary question from Lim Kit Siang (DAP - Tanjung), Loke said the Government had spent about 53 per cent of the RM2 billion allocated for hosting the Games. The Opposition leader had questioned the rationale in accepting MAS Catering's offer of providing food for the athletes at RM120 per day per athlete, taking into consideration current economic conditions.
