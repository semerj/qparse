HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Germany's Gunda Niemann smashed the 3,000-meter speedskating world record Saturday in a time of 4 minutes 5.08 seconds, shattering the old record of fellow German Claudia Pechstein which stood at 4:07.13. Niemann began her race calmly and picked up pace in the middle laps before accelerating to the new record in the closing two laps at the indoor Thialf ice stadium. Racing in the next pair, Pechstein skated 4:07.36 for second place in the race, a time that left her second to Niemann in the all-round championship with just Sunday's 5,000-meter race left. A third German, Anni Friesinger, was third in the 3,000 meters in a time of 4:11.57. "This is such a great tournament. Lots of people are skating personal bests and that motivated me," Niemann said. Earlier Saturday, reigning men's world all-round champion Ids Postma of the Netherlands virtually guaranteed he will retain his title by narrowly beating Dutch rival Rintje Ritsma in a thrilling 1,500-meter race. Drawn together in the race's last pairing, Postma clocked 1:48.85 to edge Ritsma's time of 1:48.86 and complete a sweep of the first three of races in the four-distance all-round championship. "It was a great fight," Postma said. "The (time) difference was actually nothing." Ritsma conceded that the title is now almost certainly out of his reach. With just Sunday's 10,000-meter race to go, the difference in the men's cumulative times "is enough for Ids," Ritsma said. "He will have to do something very strange and I will have to do something very strange" for Postma not to win the all-round title, Ritsma added. Italian veteran Roberto Sighel was third in the 1,500 race in 1:51.19. In the day's first race, the women's 1,500 meters, defending all-round champion Niemann also pushed Pechstein into second, powering to victory in 1:58.69 seconds. U.S. skater Chris Witty also ducked under the two-minute mark to land third place in 1:59.46. (mc)
