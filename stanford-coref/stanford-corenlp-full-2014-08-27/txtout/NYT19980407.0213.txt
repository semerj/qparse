NEW ORLEANS _ In a town famous for its flamboyance, {{Susan Spicer}} is the city's stealth chef. Unlike Emeril Legasse or Justin Wilson, {{Susan Spicer}} speaks softly, has no desire to build a restaurant empire and serves neither Cajun nor Creole food. But if {{Susan Spicer}} is quiet and self-deprecating, the food at {{Susan Spicer}} restaurant, {{Bayona}}, shines, and {{Susan Spicer}} is widely regarded as one of the cooking luminaries of New Orleans, and of the nation as well, as {{Susan Spicer}} is routinely cited in surveys of America's best chefs. {{Susan Spicer}} intimate restaurant in the French Quarter is packed nightly with locals as well as tourists who appreciate {{Susan Spicer}} uncluttered cooking, which relies on the goodness of the ingredients and {{Susan Spicer}} captivating approach. {{Susan Spicer}} food reflects {{Susan Spicer}} wide-ranging interests: {{Susan Spicer}} has lived in France and Holland, and has traveled throughout most of the Mediterranean and the United States. From {{Susan Spicer}} mother, who is Danish, she learned variety. "She was as likely to serve fried chicken as curry," {{Susan Spicer}} said. But some of {{Susan Spicer}} food also mirrors a Louisiana sensibility. She uses oysters to stuff roasted quail, and encrusts rabbit with pecans and serves it with a sauce made from Cajun tasso ham. Her Thai spicy shrimp, on the other hand, is brilliantly seasoned and authentically Thai, with beautifully balanced flavors. The presentations are simple and straightforward. No towers of food and other show-off architecture. Success came quickly to {{Susan Spicer}} when {{Susan Spicer}} opened {{Susan Spicer}} own restaurant in 1990, but it was not before years of casting about for a career. {{Susan Spicer}}, 45, considers {{Susan Spicer}} a late bloomer. {{Susan Spicer}} claims to have failed at everything else {{Susan Spicer}} tried. "{{Susan Spicer}} was {{Susan Spicer}}, and {{Susan Spicer}} was fired, and {{Susan Spicer}} was a bad secretary," {{Susan Spicer}} said, a small smile playing around {{Susan Spicer}} mouth. "So {{Susan Spicer}} could be considered a change-of-career person if {{Susan Spicer}} had ever had a career. {{Susan Spicer}} was {{Susan Spicer}}, and {{Susan Spicer}} was restless. {{Susan Spicer}} started cooking at 26, but {{Susan Spicer}} was always looking for a creative outlet. Nothing came easy." {{Susan Spicer}} began {{Susan Spicer}} culinary career in 1979 by apprenticing {{Susan Spicer}} to a French chef in New Orleans. Then {{Susan Spicer}} spent four months working at all the stations in a Parisian restaurant kitchen, knowing that when {{Susan Spicer}} returned to New Orleans {{Susan Spicer}} boss expected {{Susan Spicer}} to become the chef of a restaurant he was opening. {{Susan Spicer}} said {{Susan Spicer}} didn't feel {{Susan Spicer}} was qualified, but the decision was out of {{Susan Spicer}} hands. "Being a chef when {{Susan Spicer}} felt {{Susan Spicer}} wasn't ready was pretty stressful," {{Susan Spicer}} said. "Everyone {{Susan Spicer}} hired {{Susan Spicer}} thought knew more than {{Susan Spicer}} did. {{Susan Spicer}} was really kind of afraid a lot of the time. So {{Susan Spicer}} left and went back to Europe and worked here and there." {{Susan Spicer}} returned to New Orleans a year later and, in 1986, was the opening chef at the Bistro in the Maison de Ville hotel, where {{Susan Spicer}} stayed until {{Bayona}} became a reality. It was an immediate success, turning a profit within six months. Even though {{Bayona}} has a national reputation among the cognoscenti, and even though {{Susan Spicer}} feels "pretty confident" about what {{Susan Spicer}} is doing, {{Susan Spicer}} thinks {{Susan Spicer}} has a long way to go. "{{Bayona}} is still evolving," {{Susan Spicer}} said, on a recent afternoon as {{Susan Spicer}} cooked some of {{Susan Spicer}} favorite dishes in the cooking-school kitchen of {{Susan Spicer}} shop, which {{Susan Spicer}} recently opened. "You have to stay fresh. {{Susan Spicer}} want to keep it that way. {{Susan Spicer}} don't think {{Susan Spicer}} have enough energy to inject into five different projects." {{Susan Spicer}} is determined to keep growing as a cook. "One of the things {{Susan Spicer}}'m good at is putting flavors together," {{Susan Spicer}} said. "{{Susan Spicer}} have good instincts about food and wine, probably from being adventurous at a very young age. {{Susan Spicer}} can sit in {{Susan Spicer}} office and put a menu together. But in terms of technique, {{Susan Spicer}} would like to be more confident." {{Susan Spicer}}, who has dark blond hair and intense pale blue eyes, describes {{Susan Spicer}} as shy, but {{Susan Spicer}} does not go unnoticed: people always remember {{Susan Spicer}} because of the band {{Susan Spicer}} wears across {{Susan Spicer}} forehead when {{Susan Spicer}} cooks. Except, of course, in the presence of a reporter, when the headband moves to the back of {{Susan Spicer}} hair, and any leftover hippie traits are disguised. Those who have seen {{Susan Spicer}} conduct a cooking class describe her as lively and funny, sharing intimate secrets of her private life, talking about her younger boyfriend, for example, who is also the manager of her shop. She describes this mingling of her personal and professional lives as "a pretty dangerous thing to do," adding in an offhanded manner that she is "past the point of worrying about getting married." {{Susan Spicer}} came to cooking in spite of {{Susan Spicer}} father and because of {{Susan Spicer}} mother. "{{Susan Spicer}} dad had really high hopes for {{Susan Spicer}} scholastically," {{Susan Spicer}} said. "{{Susan Spicer}} did well in school. {{Susan Spicer}} skipped a grade when {{Susan Spicer}} was a kid, and he wanted {{Susan Spicer}} to be some sort of engineer, something less earthy than a cook. {{Susan Spicer}} wanted to go to the Culinary Institute of America, but he didn't want to pay for it." Despite the lack of the architectural plates that are so in vogue today, despite the fact that the food is neither Cajun nor Creole and that the chef does not have a television cooking series, not even a cookbook, {{Susan Spicer}} patrons have come to trust her. "I think we keep it interesting enough without intimidating people," she said. {{Susan Spicer}} understated style is apparent, too, in the look of {{Susan Spicer}} new shop called Spice Inc. : clean and spare. The shop is taking off, even though its location makes {{Susan Spicer}} an urban pioneer. Spice Inc. opened late last year in a warehouse district on its way to gentrification. The grungy exterior of the historic Cotton Mill Building provides no clue to {{Susan Spicer}} airy shop on the first floor. Sunlight streams in through floor-to-ceiling windows. The loft-like decor _ exposed metal pipes, light woods, a painted cement floor _ provides the background for enticing displays of prepared foods like sesame-crusted tuna, Thai green curry chicken and Shorty's macaroni and cheese as well as an ample selection of fruits, vegetables and cheeses. The shop makes its own European-style bread; it is the first to do so in New Orleans, {{Susan Spicer}} said. Spice could not look more different from {{Bayona}}, which is in the heart of the French Quarter in a 200-year -old Creole cottage with French jalousie doors. The restaurant has three intimate dining rooms, with ceiling fans, terra-cotta walls, crisp white linens and lighting that makes everyone look good. A glassed-in garden room looks out on an incredibly romantic brick-walled garden. Yet, for all its charm, it is as understated as the owner. "{{Susan Spicer}}'m not looking to provoke," {{Susan Spicer}} said. "{{Susan Spicer}}'m not {{Susan Spicer}}. {{Susan Spicer}}'m glad there are people who do that, but essentially {{Susan Spicer}} just want it to taste good." <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE.
