NEW YORK _ It was easier for {{Chris Childs}} to be with the Nets two years ago. Less pressure, no hype. Having freedom from expectation meant wowing everyone as a playmaking guard with a freewheeling style. He lost his anonymity that summer when he signed a $24 million deal with the Knicks. He went just across the river, but to another world, as a high-profile point guard. He has been adjusting ever since. This injury-riddled season, in which he went from starter to backup, has been particularly difficult and increasingly dreadful for {{Chris Childs}}. In his last three games, {{Chris Childs}} has made four of 17 shots and committed seven turnovers in 68 minutes of playing time. "{{Chris Childs}}'m not happy with the way {{Chris Childs}}'m playing," {{Chris Childs}} said after an 0 -for- 2, three-turnover performance against the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday night. "{{Chris Childs}}'m not getting the ball to the basket. {{Chris Childs}} leg is not hurting as much as it did before, so {{Chris Childs}}'ve got to get there. {{Chris Childs}}'m going to play {{Chris Childs}} game on Saturday." If {{Chris Childs}} does, {{Chris Childs}} return to the Childs of old will take place Saturday night at Continental Arena, where {{Chris Childs}} was so comfortable with the Nets. As much as {{Chris Childs}} has struggled as a Knick _ not clicking with either the {{Patrick Ewing}} -oriented offense or the current one without the injured center _ {{Chris Childs}} is only half of the point guard problem. {{Charlie Ward}}, the starter, has also hit a season-low lull. At times, {{Charlie Ward}} has been clutch in {{Charlie Ward}} shots and smart in {{Charlie Ward}} passes off penetration. But over the same three games that {{Chris Childs}} game has worsened, {{Charlie Ward}} shooting has been worse. {{Chris Childs}} has made one of 15 shots and is 0 for 5 from 3-point range. "I'm not really worried about their scoring," Knicks coach {{Jeff Van Gundy}} said. "Charlie is aggressive and looks for other guys. We just want to make sure he maintains the right balance and takes his own shot when he's open. "{{Chris Childs}} has got to play through it and keep working." That means doing the extra shooting {{Jeff Van Gundy}} has been banging the drum for lately. As a team, particularly in the backcourt over the last week, the Knick players' shots have fallen hard on the rim. Now is not the time for an offensive swoon, not when the Knicks are trying to hold fast to a playoff position. Teams like the eighth-place Nets are in the chase for the Knicks ' No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference. "Before, we were in the favorite's position," said {{Jeff Van Gundy}}, whose team held a three-and-a-half-game lead over the Nets. "They were always the underdog. {{Jeff Van Gundy}} think that's all changed." So much has changed since {{Chris Childs}} was with the Nets. With the Knicks, it is not so easy to be {{Chris Childs}}. "{{Chris Childs}} was brought here for other aspects of {{Chris Childs}} game; {{Chris Childs}}'ve got to show that," said {{Chris Childs}}, who admits the ankle that {{Chris Childs}} sprained six weeks ago is not what is bothering {{Chris Childs}} now. "{{Chris Childs}}'ve been stagnate, not playing {{Chris Childs}} game. That is going to end on Saturday." REBOUNDS {{Patrick Ewing}} continued to go through shooting drills Friday at practice and ran through some plays with the team. A team official said Thursday night that {{Patrick Ewing}} is expected to return to a full-contact practice within 10 days, the final step for a return before the playoffs. "{{Jeff Van Gundy}} expect he'll practice before the end of the season at some point," {{Jeff Van Gundy}} said Friday before describing {{Patrick Ewing}} workout. "When we went contact, he didn't play. If he's able to, contact would be the next step. It would be a huge step." Barring a setback to his surgically repaired shooting wrist, {{Patrick Ewing}} could be in uniform for one of the Knicks ' final regular-season games. {{Patrick Ewing}} touch was in full view before the Knicks ' 81 - 70 victory over the Clippers on Thursday, when {{Patrick Ewing}} shot 10 - to 18-foot jumpers for about half an hour and looked surprisingly smooth in {{Patrick Ewing}} release.
