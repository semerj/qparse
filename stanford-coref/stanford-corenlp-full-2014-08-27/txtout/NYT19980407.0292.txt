CHICAGO _ "{{Eppie Lederer}}'m in the middle of everything," said {{Eppie Lederer}}. She was speaking of Chicago, the hometown she loves, but she could have been pinpointing her own spot on the cultural map. As {{Ann Landers}}, {{Eppie Lederer}} has been the arbiter of Main Street American mores since 1955, dishing out advice seven days a week in a column that the Guinness Book of World Records says is the most widely syndicated in the world, with 90 million readers in some 1,200 newspapers. {{Ann Landers}} receives 2,000 letters a day. {{Eppie Lederer}} isn't slowing down as {{Eppie Lederer}} approaches 80 (on the Fourth of July). I'd come to {{Eppie Lederer}} palatial apartment above Lake Michigan to learn how {{Eppie Lederer}} and {{Eppie Lederer}} readers had survived the {{Bill Clinton}} sex scandals. "{{Eppie Lederer}} have the pulse of the nation, so to speak," {{Eppie Lederer}} said. Dressed in red _ and speaking in the firecracker Chicago newsroom rhythms of "The Front Page" _ {{Eppie Lederer}} might BE the pulse of the nation. A Democrat, {{Eppie Lederer}} has kept {{Eppie Lederer}} readers' trust by never endorsing politicians _ or products or fads. While {{Ronald Reagan}} and Jimmy Carter appointed {{Eppie Lederer}} to boards and {{Bill Clinton}} invited {{Eppie Lederer}} to stay in the Lincoln Bedroom ("No money connected _ {{Bill Clinton}} gave {{Ronald Reagan}} nothing!"), {{Eppie Lederer}} will vouch for the private life of just one of the many presidents {{Eppie Lederer}} has known: "{{Truman}} is the one {{Eppie Lederer}} would bet on _ that {{Truman}} was absolutely, totally faithful to Bess." As for the {{Bill Clinton}} accusations and revelations: "{{Eppie Lederer}} didn't know what {{Eppie Lederer}}'d get from readers. Would {{Bill Clinton}} be outraged? Would there be a lot of anti- {{Bill Clinton}} stuff? {{Eppie Lederer}} was surprised _ there was so little negative mail and such an outpouring of support. {{Eppie Lederer}} have concluded this is a very popular president. {{Bill Clinton}}'re saying it's not our business, and we don't care... This is not just sophisticated New York and California. This is Middle America. {{Eppie Lederer}} column appears in a lot of small-town papers _ Des Moines ; Muskegon ; Tyler, Texas." {{Paula Jones}} "The readers knew who was prompting {{Paula Jones}}, who gave {{Paula Jones}} the makeover. They don't buy it. {{Eppie Lederer}} say hurray for the American public!" {{Monica Lewinsky}} "They feel sorry for {{Monica Lewinsky}}. They feel {{Monica Lewinsky}}'s a little long in the tooth to be chasing celebrities. {{Monica Lewinsky}} isn't a teen-ager." {{Kenneth Starr}} "{{Kenneth Starr}} failed. {{Kenneth Starr}} should go to Pepperdine already." {{Linda Tripp}} "{{Linda Tripp}} is {{Linda Tripp}}, {{Bill Clinton}} tell you. {{Bill Clinton}}'ve had absolutely no positive mail about {{Linda Tripp}}." But doesn't the public's refusal to condemn {{Bill Clinton}} signal some kind of moral collapse? {{Eppie Lederer}}, whose own marriage ended in divorce in 1975, said: "People are much more willing to forgive now. They are more permissive. They are more realistic. This is the way life is. Not all husbands are faithful... {{Eppie Lederer}}'ve been doing this 43 years. The country has been going in this direction for some time. {{Eppie Lederer}} don't think it's just the Clintons. We're getting to be more forgiving as a people. It's a good thing." {{Eppie Lederer}} also dismissed the notion that the nation's children had been scarred by the nonstop talk of oral sex and adultery: "It's awfully hard to shock a kid above 8 years of age in this country unless they're living in a glass bubble. The children know a heck of a lot more than their parents think they do. {{Eppie Lederer}} knew more than {{Eppie Lederer}} parents thought {{Eppie Lederer}} knew." {{Eppie Lederer}} attributes today's kids' knowledge about sex to TV. {{Eppie Lederer}} grew up in pre-TV Sioux City, Iowa, but {{Abe Friedman}}, {{Abe Friedman}}, owned theaters, among them a burlesque house. "That's where my sister" _ {{Pauline}}, {{Pauline}}, who writes the rival "Dear Abby" column _ "and I got our sex education. We were 15 years old and the girls in the chorus were 16 years old. We hung out backstage because we liked them. We talked to them a lot, and we heard PLENTY." In other words, I asked, you don't find the {{Bill Clinton}} scandals particularly momentous? {{Eppie Lederer}} abruptly got up, went to an adjoining room and came back with a big scrapbook. In it were photos of {{Eppie Lederer}} visit with American soldiers in a Saigon hospital in 1967. "War is what's important," {{Eppie Lederer}} said, turning the pages. "This is what counts _ not this other kind of stuff about {{Linda Tripp}}. Who cares about {{Linda Tripp}}? The American people are pretty solid, they're pretty savvy, and they know what's important. That's why they're not screaming and yelling about {{Bill Clinton}} and some of these females." Then {{Eppie Lederer}} put down the scrapbook to offer some advice. "This," {{Eppie Lederer}} said, "is where you should end your column."
