STONE MOUNTAIN, Ga. _ Those tennis fans intrepid enough to brave severe thunderstorms in hopes of viewing Day 1 of the first-round Davis Cup encounter between the United States and Russia wound up pocketing their soggy American flags and unfurling umbrellas Friday afternoon at the International Tennis Center. An official washout was declared about 4:30 p.m. and both singles matches were postponed until Saturday because the team captains refused to start a match under the lights. "The guys like to acclimate to the conditions, and nobody has hit one practice ball at night under the lights," said Tom Gullikson, the U.S. captain who admitted he would have preferred to play the doubles on Saturday following the two singles, a scenario the Russians rejected. A pair of former French Open champions, 53rd-ranked Jim Courier, who is backing Andre Agassi in singles, and sixth-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Russia's nonsecret weapon for singles and doubles, were scheduled to open the competition Friday. The American doubles team of Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg will play Sunday morning, and the two reverse singles matches will, pending the length of the doubles match, follow, starting at 2 p.m. If doubles lasts 30 games or more, Russia can demand that the singles be moved to Monday. The Russian captain, Shamil Tarpichev, indicated that he and Kafelnikov, who faces Agassi in the fourth match, would make their decision depending on the score between the countries once doubles has been played. The last washout for the United States in Davis Cup play was in 1986 against Mexico.
