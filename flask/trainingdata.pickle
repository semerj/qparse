Taylor State Park, in Marin, supervising ranger Rose Blackburn is reassessing her use of volunteer campground hosts. In exchange for free RV space, they work 20 hours a week helping park visitors and handling emergencies. In peak season, she now has two campground hosts and may expand that to three or four, with one host concentrating on maintenance. One surefire revenue enhancement at Taylor is a new lodging option: five new primitive cabins that she hopes will be ready for visitors this summer, at $100 a night or so (compared with $35 for a campsite).

It was one of the first instances of a "wired" courtroom: lawyers were provided computers linked to a mainframe in Texas to share documents.

By the 1960s, Fuller had found a mass audience, not within the auto industry but within the emerging counterculture, for which the idea of doing less with more was apposite. He gave lectures of epic length,  inspiring renegades half his age to act on his beliefs.

"Fuller's lectures have a raga quality of rich, nonlinear, endless improvisation," read an introductory tribute by Stewart Brand, the publisher. From Brand's LSD-enhanced perspective, Fuller preached self-sufficiency, which Brand sought to realize via his catalog \u2014 a mail-order sourcebook for everything from hunting boots to CB radios. "I was persuaded by Fuller that tools and techniques were the essence of human progress," he wrote in an email, "whereas politics often was a complete distraction."

Officials at CIR said they were considering dropping The Bay Citizen's breaking news and cultural coverage.
