HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Germany's Gunda Niemann smashed the 3,000-meter speedskating world record Saturday in a time of 4 minutes 5.08 seconds, shattering the old record of fellow German Claudia Pechstein which stood at 4:07.13. Niemann began her race calmly and picked up pace in the middle laps before accelerating to the new record in the closing two laps at the indoor Thialf ice stadium. Racing in the next pair, Pechstein skated 4:07.36 for second place in the race, a time that left her second to Niemann in the all-round championship with just Sunday's 5,000-meter race left. (mc)
