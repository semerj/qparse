NEW YORK _ Treasury securities rallied sharply on Friday on news of the surprising drop in employment last month. "The jobs report is likely to convert many Asian-slowdown disbelievers into ardent supporters of this view and ignite fresh hope that the central bank is not likely to even think of raising rates any time soon," said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisors Corp., in Columbus, Ohio. Indeed, Chan said, Fed policy makers are now likely "to open debate on when, not if, they should consider lowering short-term rates." The price of the 30-year bond rose 23/32, to 104 23/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 5.79 percent, from 5.84 percent on Thursday _ the lowest since 5.79 percent on Feb. 17. Jack Ablin, president of Barnett Capital Advisors Inc., in Jacksonville, Fla., said that market concerns heading into the second quarter had been over the Asian crisis and wage pressures. "The issue the market needed to grapple with was whether the Asian crisis was going to be enough to help offset the wage and inflation pressures we were facing," he said. "To date, while the Asia situation is still there, the employment numbers today went a long way to alleviate those concerns." Elsewhere in the market, in when-issued trading on Friday ahead of next week's $8-billion auction of 30-year inflation-indexed bonds on Wednesday, the bonds were being offered at a price to yield 3.64 percent, down 3 basis points from the previous day. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
