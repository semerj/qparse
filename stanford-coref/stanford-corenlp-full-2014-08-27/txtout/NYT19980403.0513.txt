OAKLAND, {{Joe Torre}} Yankee cap was tilted back high on {{Joe Torre}} forehead after Thursday night's 10 - 2 loss to the Angels in Anaheim, a dumbfounded expression overwhelming {{Joe Torre}} face. With a beer in {{Joe Torre}} hand, {{Joe Torre}} could have been a dead ringer for Walter Matthau as the manager of the Bad News Bears. "They kicked our rears," {{Joe Torre}} said. "We didn't help matters any." The Yankees can blame El Nino. They can blame the American League schedule. They can blame themselves. Regardless, they arrived here Friday after having lost the first two games of a season of high hopes with a toothless offensive attack and sometimes brainless play on defense. "It was an ugly game," said {{David Cone}}, who makes {{David Cone}} first start Saturday against Oakland. "An ugly way to lose; it was embarrassing. It was the type of game that you hope could be a wake-up call. "Nonetheless, I still like this team." {{Derek Jeter}}, {{Derek Jeter}}, reiterated what {{Joe Torre}} had mentioned, that the Yankees ' preparation was affected by the El Nino-driven rain last weekend in San Diego, all the hours of batting and infield practice washed away. {{George Steinbrenner}}, {{George Steinbrenner}}, said Thursday {{George Steinbrenner}} would request that {{George Steinbrenner}} team open at Yankee Stadium next season. The 1997 opener was indoors, in Seattle. The Yankees went 4 - 4 on that first West Coast swing, while Baltimore _ which always opens at Camden Yards _ jumped ahead in the standing. Every trip to the West Coast in recent years has challenged the Yankees, who are 64 - 83 on this side of the country in the 1990s. Rain, West Coast, whatever, the Yankees are 0 - 2. {{Ramiro Mendoza}}, {{Ramiro Mendoza}}, started Friday night against the Athletics. In Thursday's defeat, there were no errors charged to the Yankees. But they played miserably, making more mistakes in one game than in the final two weeks of spring training. In the first inning, the Yankees threatened. {{Derek Jeter}} singled and Paul O'Neill walked with one out. {{Bernie Williams}} smashed a line drive to center field, where {{Jim Edmonds}} stepped forward and caught the ball neck-high. {{Derek Jeter}}, running on contact, was almost at third and was easily doubled off second base to end the inning. Dismissing the unthinkable _ that {{Derek Jeter}} forgot the number of outs _ {{Joe Torre}} said {{Joe Torre}} thought {{Bernie Williams}} liner was going to land for a hit. {{Derek Jeter}} said {{Derek Jeter}} did, too. "{{Derek Jeter}} was thinking 'score,' even though it was hit hard, and {{Derek Jeter}} was trying to get a good jump," {{Derek Jeter}} said. "{{Jim Edmonds}} caught it like {{Jim Edmonds}} was camped under a fly ball." Anaheim scored three runs in the fourth inning against {{David Wells}}, but if the Yankee infielders had made the plays, the damage could have been limited to one run. One out into the inning, Dave Hollins hammered a solo homer. Then Tim Salmon chopped a ball into the shortstop hole, where {{Derek Jeter}} fielded it and fired toward first. The throw skipped in front of first baseman Tino Martinez, who was unable to scoop the ball cleanly. Base hit. After {{David Wells}} walked Cecil Fielder, {{Garret Anderson}} slapped a half-speed grounder up the middle. The chances of an inning-ending double play were marginal, but any shot was lost when {{Derek Jeter}} fumbled the bouncer and settled for the out at first. Instead of being out of the inning, {{David Wells}} had to pitch to Phil Nevin with two runners on and two out, and {{David Wells}} gave up a two-run double. "That was tough," {{Derek Jeter}} said of {{Garret Anderson}}. "{{Garret Anderson}} hit {{Garret Anderson}} slow." But {{David Wells}} accepted {{David Wells}} share of the blame for the three runs; {{David Wells}} threw a fastball with no balls and two strikes to Hollins for the home run and a hanging curveball for Nevin's double. {{Darryl Strawberry}} played alongside each other in spring training without having one ball hit equidistant between {{Darryl Strawberry}}. This occurred twice Thursday, with {{Darryl Strawberry}} catching the first ball and dropping the second, as {{Darryl Strawberry}} avoided collisions with {{Bernie Williams}}. {{Darryl Strawberry}} second play was ruled a triple by Gary DiSarcina, setting up a two-run seventh. In the eighth, {{Scott Brosius}}, {{Scott Brosius}}, fielded a grounder with runners at first and third and the infield in. {{Scott Brosius}} glanced at {{Carlos Garcia}}, {{Carlos Garcia}} at third, before looking to second; {{Scott Brosius}} had forgotten that {{Chuck Knoblauch}} would not be covering the base with the infield in. So {{Scott Brosius}} quickly threw to first. {{Carlos Garcia}} noted {{Scott Brosius}} indecision and scored. As the infielders reset for the next hitter, {{Scott Brosius}} tapped his chest, acknowledging his mistake. Later, {{Darryl Strawberry}} overthrew a cutoff man. "Hopefully, we got all the garbage out of the way," said {{Joe Torre}}, for one night the manager of the bad news Yankees. INSIDE PITCH {{Chili Davis}}, {{Chili Davis}}, left Thursday night's game after {{Chili Davis}} third at-bat with what {{Joe Torre}} described as pain in {{Joe Torre}} right foot. "{{Chili Davis}} foot was a little numb," {{Joe Torre}} said. "{{Chili Davis}} had {{Chili Davis}} shoe tied a little too tight."... The Yankees went 1 for 16 with runners in scoring position in the first two games... {{Chuck Knoblauch}} has reached base in six of his nine plate appearances... {{Orlando Hernandez}}, {{Orlando Hernandez}}, pitched two solid innings in a simulated game against Class A players in Tampa, Fla., allowing two infield hits.
