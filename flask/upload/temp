WASHINGTON -- They had packed up their comforters, antacids and Jimi Hendrix records.

Then Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, pointed to a dusty item he did not recognize. Was it a piece of Asian art, he wondered?

Not exactly. "In Christian families, that would be called a Christmas tree holder," Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, wryly explained to his Jewish friend.

It was the end of the real "Alpha House," the crumbling gray-blue rowhouse in the shadow of the Capitol where a group of powerful Democratic lawmakers -- including Mr. Miller, Mr. Schumer, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and a rotating cast of supporting players -- have lived for more than three decades.

Mr. Miller, the owner of the two-story, two-bedroom house, is retiring after 40 years in Congress and is selling the home that inspired the Amazon web series "Alpha House," as well as countless punch lines about the crash pad's fraternity-meets-policy seminar vibe.

And so, on a chilly morning last week, the house's final inhabitants -- Mr. Miller, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer -- gathered one last time to finish clearing out boxes and say goodbye.

"For us, it's the end of an era," said Mr. Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat.

"It's the end of America as we know it," agreed Mr. Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat.

The surroundings, perhaps, did not suggest the historic import of the occasion. A lamp rested precariously on a stack of hardcover books, an oversize mousetrap remained in wait in the kitchen, and the refrigerator offered a lingering odor and a handful of Bud Lights.

At one point, a bounty of venison given to the house by Mr. Miller's son, who had shot a deer, sat in the freezer for 12 years, until the freezer finally broke and they had to throw out the meat. "We didn't know that aged, dried venison was going to become really popular," Mr. Miller said.

The home -- once nicknamed "Washington's Algonquin table" -- has provided refuge to a rumpled crew of Democratic lawmakers over the years, including former representatives like William D. Delahunt of Massachusetts, Samuel Gejdenson of Connecticut, Leon E. Panetta of California and Marty Russo of Illinois (who moved in during a snowstorm and stayed for a decade, until he was defeated in Congress).

The men have traded parenting advice (a "group date," they concluded, was a safe option for Mr. Schumer's then-preteen daughter) and political strategy. In the 1980s, the roommates began talking about a new type of single-payer health care plan, with Mr. Russo ultimately writing the bill.

Mr. Schumer remembered Tip O'Neill, the former House speaker, calling after midnight on "the dial phone we used to have" and asking: " 'What trouble are you guys going to create for me tomorrow?' Because we were sort of the young rebels."

Now older and creakier, the men are heading their separate ways. Mr. Miller, who Mr. Schumer jokes has spent more nights with him than with his wife, is returning to California. Mr. Durbin is moving a few blocks away, to a one-bedroom apartment. And Mr. Schumer, who currently sleeps in a bed wedged between the kitchen and the living room on the ground floor, is "trading up" by renting an apartment in the building where one of his daughters lives.

The move should alleviate some dicey moments of intraparty tension. After a tough election for Democrats in 2010, for example, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Durbin both found themselves vying for position within the party's leadership ranks, and the tension became so bad at one point that Mr. Durbin considered moving out.

The house's remaining artifacts harken to a different time, both in the nation's capital and the Capitol itself. A "Mountain Fiddler" vinyl record by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, rests on a shelf, autographed for Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. (Mr. Byrd died in 2010, and Mr. Dodd became a lobbyist in 2011 after retiring from the Senate.)

Mr. Schumer pointed to some cowboy hats, which he and Mr. Miller wore to a 1982 White House barbecue, when Ronald Reagan was president. "He was very friendly," Mr. Schumer said.

"It was just different than it is now," Mr. Miller said. "He sat at the picnic. He came over and said hello. We talked to him and his wife."

In a full-circle twist, Mr. Miller is selling the house to Ari Gejdenson, the son of his onetime roommate, Samuel Gejdenson. The younger Mr. Gejdenson is a Washington restaurateur whom the lawmakers remember as a boy, playing gin rummy at the kitchen counter.

"I used to stay there a few nights a week, whenever they were in session," Ari Gejdenson said. "My dad's cellphone number is still stuck under the wall-mounted phone. The same couch I used to sleep on is still in the living room. It brings me back to my childhood, for sure."

The younger Mr. Gejdenson offered to let the senators stay, but was going to charge them closer to market rent -- they currently pay about $800 a month -- and there was talk of bringing in new roommates.

"That was the most worrisome part," Mr. Durbin said. "Getting used to a new roommate."

A new roommate might have had trouble adjusting to the habits of the household. "They have no discipline," Mr. Miller said of Mr. Schumer and Mr. Durbin. "They don't pick up after themselves."

Cold cereal was always the food of choice, specifically the Frosted Mini-Wheats preferred by Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer. Mr. Miller's claim that he favors granola was met with jeers: "Aw, c'mon! Bleh! You're from California," Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer shouted.

"Well, I'm not running again -- I don't have to say that," Mr. Miller revised. "Cheerios. I like Cheerios."

The sitcom-like patter was a reminder that years ago, Al Franken, then still a comedian and not yet a Democratic senator from Minnesota, even made a research trip to Washington to check out the house for a CBS pilot, ultimately ill-fated, called "Little House on the Hill."

Last week, the real goodbyes seemed made for television, and in a sense they were: The lawmakers invited not only this reporter but an NBC News crew to watch their final moments, as if Mr. Miller, 69, Mr. Durbin, 70, and Mr. Schumer, 64, were truly characters in their own episode of "Alpha House."

They trotted out well-worn anecdotes about Mr. Durbin, who killed the most rats in the house, and Mr. Schumer, known for trailing food crumbs behind him.

Then Mr. Schumer began hamming it up, singing the opening lines from "Leaving on a Jet Plane." But Mr. Miller swatted at him and told him to cut it out. Mr. Miller really was leaving that night on a plane home to California, and this was the last time the men would see one another as roommates.

Mr. Miller, his mouth set in a grim line, waved goodbye one final time and walked out the front door without looking back, past a makeshift sign that reminded the "last one out" to turn off the air conditioner.

Minutes later, Mr. Schumer -- his eyes moist -- stood outside in the cold, clutching his comforter.

"I didn't realize that's when we'd be saying goodbye," he said, suddenly serious. "Whoa."
