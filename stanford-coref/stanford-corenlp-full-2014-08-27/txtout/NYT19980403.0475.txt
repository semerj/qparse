From its inception, the concept of the National Museum of the American Indian, planned for the Mall in Washington, was meant to be a design apart. American Indian elders were called in for "vision sessions" to guide the architects. {{Douglas Cardinal}}, {{Douglas Cardinal}}, is of {{Blackfoot}} ancestry. And soon {{Douglas Cardinal}} began to fashion a dramatic, swooping building of rough-hewn limestone, meant to resemble cliffs carved away, with windows aligned so that at winter and summer solstices, the sun's rays would shoot in like beams to illuminate sacred objects. At the center, {{Douglas Cardinal}} planned a circular gathering spot, or potomac, for storytellers and dancers. The museum, sitting next to the Capitol, would be a symbol of forgiveness and healing, {{Douglas Cardinal}} said. But in what it called a "drastic action," the Smithsonian Institution has terminated its contract with {{Douglas Cardinal}}, a prominent 64-year -old Canadian, and with {{Douglas Cardinal}} collaborators, GBQC Architects of Philadelphia, adding a serious complication to the life of the $110 million project. The termination, first reported this week by The Washington Post, has come after a protracted period of wrangling between the architect, who considers himself a "warrior," and the museum over delays and contractual disagreements. Last year, saying he had "run out of resources" because of the extra hours he was putting in, {{Douglas Cardinal}} decided to "make a stand," as he put it, by withholding his architectural drawings, in effect holding the project hostage. Failure to deliver the working and technical drawings, as well as procedural delays between the two firms, were major reasons for the dismissal, Smithsonian officials said. "It's a step we've taken with the greatest reluctance," said {{David Umansky}}, {{David Umansky}}, which had planned to break ground on the 250,000-square-foot project in the fall. "{{Douglas Cardinal}} did not live up to the contract. We came to the difficult decision that we had to move on if this building was going to open in the year 2002. We have an obligation to produce the museum with the money we have." The Smithsonian, {{Douglas Cardinal}} added, relies on congressional appropriations. "This Congress looks very carefully on how money is being spent." The museum says it plans to build {{Douglas Cardinal}} design _ which has already passed the hurdles of approval by the federal Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission _ with a successor yet to be named. "It's obviously been very painful," said {{J. Richard West}}, {{J. Richard West}}, a Cheyenne. "But it is our absolute intention to build {{Douglas Cardinal}} design, and to give {{Douglas Cardinal}} credit for {{Douglas Cardinal}}, with continued native involvement." The dismissal, however, has angered some of the American Indian elders who have taken part in the "vision sessions," among them, {{Lloyd Kiva New}}, {{Lloyd Kiva New}}, N.M. "The plans for this building have been drawn by a genius Native American artist who has taken the trouble to confer with Indians at every step of the way," he said. "We have a fantastic design produced by a Native American. They have no ethical right to take a man's design, whether he's Indian or Chinese. It's like letting someone finish your painting. Why don't they recognize the importance of allowing him to carry forth to see his design put into place proudly?" <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> {{Douglas Cardinal}} and GBQC are planning to appeal the decision, which they can do until April 27. In the meantime, the museum has hired another architectural team _ {{James Stewart Polshek}} and Partners of New York and Tobey and Davis of Reston, Va. _ to conduct a "peer review" of the project, to "see where we are," {{David Umansky}} said. {{James Stewart Polshek}} is currently renovating the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, part of the Smithsonian, and the cultural resource center for the Indian museum, in Maryland. There has been some speculation that {{James Stewart Polshek}} might take over the project, which {{James Stewart Polshek}} denied. But {{James Stewart Polshek}} said that, if {{James Stewart Polshek}} did, "we would do it to assist the federal government in a difficult situation. {{James Stewart Polshek}} do think the building will be completed in a way that will please {{Douglas Cardinal}}." {{Douglas Cardinal}}, who built a sweat lodge for {{Douglas Cardinal}} 12 miles from the Washington Monument after moving to Washington to work on the design, is well known in Canada for infusing {{Douglas Cardinal}} buildings with {{Douglas Cardinal}} native experience. {{Douglas Cardinal}} is {{Douglas Cardinal}}}}, French and Ojibwa. {{Douglas Cardinal}} best-known building is the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Hull, Quebec, a copper-domed, masklike structure across the river from Ottawa. The Indian Museum was {{Douglas Cardinal}} first major U.S. commission. The current dispute unfolded last year, when {{Douglas Cardinal}} asked the Smithsonian for additional reimbursement for work beyond the hours allotted in {{Douglas Cardinal}} contract. "They indicated to {{Douglas Cardinal}} they would make those provisions," {{Douglas Cardinal}} said. The museum advanced {{Douglas Cardinal}}, but by the end of the year, {{Douglas Cardinal}} said, {{Douglas Cardinal}} was "$300,000 in the hole." It was at that point, {{Douglas Cardinal}} said, that some of the elders advised him to hold his drawings until the problem was resolved. With a gift from an anonymous donor, he said, he continued the work after he was dismissed because he "wanted to get the project back on track." {{Douglas Cardinal}} is {{Douglas Cardinal}}. In the early 1980s {{Douglas Cardinal}} made headlines in Canada when {{Douglas Cardinal}} suggested that, rather than compromise {{Douglas Cardinal}} design for the Museum of Canadian Civilization, they "bulldoze it back into a park." They did not, and it opened to great fanfare. {{Trevor Boddy}} has written that the unusual cast of {{Douglas Cardinal}} designs, which have generally been situated in remote places, coupled with a cultivated outsider persona, tended to keep {{Douglas Cardinal}} off the architectural A-lists. "{{Douglas Cardinal}} is {{Douglas Cardinal}}," {{Trevor Boddy}} said in a telephone interview, "and {{Douglas Cardinal}} tends to be routinely underestimated. Every single project {{Douglas Cardinal}}'s done has had a crisis like this. {{Douglas Cardinal}}'s {{Douglas Cardinal}}." {{Douglas Cardinal}}, as is {{Douglas Cardinal}} wont, is trying to take the long view. "The elders have guided me," said the architect, who relies heavily on state-of-the-art computer technology to execute his voluptuous forms. "They want to be sure the whole building is done with honor, that it be a strong expression of their voice. That's the only way the building will have power."
