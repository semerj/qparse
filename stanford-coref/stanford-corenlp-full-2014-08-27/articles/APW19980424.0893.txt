BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A judge said the government was being too sensitive when it suspended a math teacher for comparing the size of a coin image of President Bakili Muluzi with that of his predecessor in a class exercise. Blantyre High Court Judge Eric Kumitsonyo said Thursday that he could find "nothing derogatory" in teacher Felix Mchami's remark that Muluzi's image on a coin was larger than that of the late dictator Kamuzu Banda. "Is it not true that the face of Muluzi fills the coin? And if it is full, so what?" Kumitsonyo said. Kumitsonyo adjourned the hearing and did not indicate when he will make a ruling. Mchami, who asked his pupils to measure the images during a lesson on circumference and circles, sued education authorities for wrongful dismissal. He said he was suspended for allegedly insulting Muluzi and undermining his presidential authority. The teacher, 6th graf pvs.
