MOSCOW (AP) _ Fire-fighters battled 7 hours Saturday to extinguish a blaze that raced through a newly constructed office building in St. Petersburg, according to media reports. No injuries were reported in the fire, but 40 percent of the building was destroyed, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The top six floors of the 14-story building were completely gutted and the lower floors were inundated with water sprayed from the 52 fire-trucks working at the scene. No monetary estimate for the damage was given Construction of the glass-and-concrete building, which houses St. Petersburg's Institute of Urban Studies, a furniture showroom and other businesses, was completed just last summer. Investigators are working on the theory that the fire was caused by an electric heater, ITAR-Tass reported, citing police Gen. Maj. Anatoly Ponidelko. The city's steam-heating system in the neighborhood had been cut off several days ago for non-payment of utility bills, Russian state television said. (ji)
