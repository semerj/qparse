NEW YORK _ Time has run out for the besieged Wells BDDP, the onetime Madison Avenue powerhouse that had recently stumbled into a stunning free fall as large clients left amid executive turmoil and ownership changes. GGT Group PLC, the parent of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, said on Friday that {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} would be closed after 32 years, effective on May 13. The shutdown will affect 133 employees in New York, though at the start of the year {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} had more than twice that number. Efforts will be made to place employees with affiliates of Omnicom Group, the giant agency company that agreed in late January to acquire GGT. They will be eligible for "at least six months to as much as a year" in severance pay, said {{John Wren}}, the president and chief executive at Omnicom in New York. The shutdown will abruptly end {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} battle for survival during which billings fell to less than $200 million from a peak of almost $1 billion seven years ago. Just since November, {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} has lost more than $330 million in billings from clients like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Heineken USA Inc., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. and Tag Heuer USA. The closing also ends more than three decades of advertising achievement that included such familiar campaigns as "Quality is Job 1" for Ford, "{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} can't believe {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} ate the whole thing" for Alka-Seltzer, "Oh, the disadvantages" for Benson &AMP; Hedges cigarettes and "A totally organic experience" for Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo. "{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} was one of the reasons {{Steve Davis}} got into this business," said {{Steve Davis}}, who joined {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} only six weeks ago as chairman and chief executive after the dismissal of Frank Assumma. "To look at the agency's reel was to see the best and the brightest," {{Steve Davis}} said. "But it got to the point there was not enough critical mass to keep going. "And for {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} to dance {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} way into a 'merger' with another agency would have been fairly transparent," {{Steve Davis}} added, "because there's not that much left to merge with." The client roster of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} and {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} affiliate, {{Moss/Dragoti}}, had dwindled to five accounts. With the closing date posted, four of the five have started leaving for other agencies; the fifth, Chase Manhattan Corp., had already placed its account in review. Omnicom moved to acquire GGT after the loss of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} largest client, Procter &AMP; Gamble _ with billings estimated at $125 million _ plunged GGT into crisis. The hope had been widespread that {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} would somehow remain in business, perhaps as a unit of an Omnicom agency like DDB Needham Worldwide or TBWA Chiat/Day. But "there was virtually no revenue left" because of the substantial account losses, {{John Wren}} said. That sealed {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} fate, on a Friday the 13th no less. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> "I feel terrible about this," said {{Moss/Dragoti}}, {{Moss/Dragoti}}, who was one of the initial employees of {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} when it opened as {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, Rich, Greene in 1966. "It's very sad to see it happen." "We should have a memorial service someday," {{Moss/Dragoti}} added, "to say goodbye in a nice way." Two clients that had been handled by {{Moss/Dragoti}} are headed for DDB Needham in New York along with {{Moss/Dragoti}} and {{Moss/Dragoti}} longtime partner, Stan Dragoti. One is Hertz Corp. and the other is the History Channel, the cable television network owned by Walt Disney Co., Hearst Corp. and the NBC unit of General Electric Co. Combined billings are estimated at more than $40 million. {{Ken Kaess}}, {{Ken Kaess}}, was pleased to land two additional clients unexpectedly but was dismayed at the circumstances. "It's too bad," {{Ken Kaess}} said. "{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} is {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}." {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} had for years been burnished by {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, whose fierce devotion to clients and creative instincts made {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} an advertising legend. {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} fledgling agency grew quickly from the 1960s into the 1970s, attracting blue-chip clients like Ford Motor Co. ; ITT Sheraton Corp. ; IBM ; Miles Inc., now part of Bayer ; Philip Morris Cos. ; and P&AMP;G. "{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} created an environment and an attitude here," {{Steve Davis}} said, "and underpinned it with great people who delivered on that promise. {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} could always be depended on for something new and different." But after the agency was sold in 1990 to BDDP, a French agency company, {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} withdrew from active involvement, and financial problems began to impede {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} performance. {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} then suffered through waves of account losses and management tumult as well as another change in ownership when BDDP was acquired last year by GGT. For instance, one six-month period in 1995 brought the sudden departures from Wells of the chairman and chief executive, {{Ken Kaess}} and the chief financial officer. "It was a big roller coaster," said {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}}, who worked at {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} in a top creative post from 1994 to 1997. "{{Mary Wells Lawrence}} went on a maternity leave, and when {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} came back, nobody was there. "It was an unfortunate sequence of happenstances," {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} added. "No one person is responsible; everyone there had the best of intentions." Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, an advertising and production company that {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}} opened after leaving {{Mary Wells Lawrence}}, is being awarded the account of another {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} client, Toys "R" Us, with billings estimated at $30 million to $40 million. {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}} had worked for Toys "R" Us at {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} and at the J. Walter Thompson New York unit of WPP Group, where she wrote the Toys "R" Us jingle. {{Linda Kaplan Thaler}} had been bound by a noncompetition agreement with {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} that expires in July. But the closing led {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} to waive the stricture so the account could move now. The fourth Wells account moving to another agency is the packaged paper-products division of Georgia-Pacific Corp., which arrived at {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} only last fall. Like Hertz and the History Channel, it is also leaving for an Omnicom -owned agency, the BBDO South unit of BBDO Worldwide. BBDO South in Atlanta, which handles corporate advertising for Georgia-Pacific, will assume additional duties for brands like Angel Soft toilet tissue and Sparkle paper towels, said {{Ken Haldin}}, {{Ken Haldin}}. Billings were estimated at $30 million to $40 million. Omnicom anticipates completing the acquisition of GGT in the next two weeks, {{John Wren}} said, adding that {{John Wren}} planned to sponsor a "three-day job fair to try to place as many Wells employees as possible" at Omnicom agencies and subsidiaries. "The employees are the innocent victims of all these events," {{John Wren}} added. {{Steve Davis}}, who said {{Steve Davis}} would consider {{Steve Davis}} next move after {{Mary Wells Lawrence}} closed, agreed with Wren. "{{Steve Davis}} told the staff this didn't have anything to do with them," {{Steve Davis}} said, referring to {{Steve Davis}} remarks at a meeting at the Wells office on Friday afternoon. "{{Steve Davis}}'ve never seen such passion and conviction in the face of having to read about the agency in the papers every day."
