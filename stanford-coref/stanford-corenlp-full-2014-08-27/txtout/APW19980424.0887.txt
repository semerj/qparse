COPYRIGHT 1998 BY WORLDSOURCES, INC., A JOINT VENTURE OF FDCH, INC. AND WORLD TIMES, INC. NO PORTION OF THE MATERIALS CONTAINED HEREIN MAY BE USED IN ANY MEDIA WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION TO WORLDSOURCES, INC. THE Companies Act 1965 needs to be amended to check against the unhealthy activities of non-governmental organisations operating under the disguise of companies. Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade and {{Datuk S. Subramaniam}} told the Dewan Rakyat that some of these NGOs were found to be carrying out activities not in the interest of the public or national security. Tabling the Companies (Amendment) (No.2) Bill 1997 for a second reading, he said a new section had been proposed to empower the Registrar of Companies to refuse registration of the memorandum of a proposed company if he was satisfied that it was likely to be used for unlawful purposes, or any purpose prejudicial to or incompatible with peace, welfare, security, public order, good order or morality, or prejudicial to national security or public interest. The amendments also seek to provide additional grounds for the courts to compulsorily wind up a company if it is being used as specified above. {{Datuk S. Subramaniam}} said the amendments were also aimed at ensuring companies would be more responsible in matters pertaining to their accounts. As the accounts have to be made out in accordance with approved accounting standards with certain exceptions, they would be able to reflect the real performance of the companies. During the debate, {{Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang}} felt suitable measures must be introduced to help companies facing problems due to economic uncertainties. {{Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang}} proposed that creditors and management of companies find an amicable solution to overcome their financial difficulties. {{Datuk Abu Zahar Ujang}} said the ROC needed to improve its services and administration, and one way this could be achieved was through its corporatisation. Lim Kit Siang (DAP - Tanjung) focused his debate on one of his favourite topics - questioning the Government on its move to bail out companies now in difficulties due to economic problems. Reiterating his stand that the various corporate exercises involving companies like Malaysia Airlines, Renong, Konsortium Perkapalan, United Engineers Malaysia and others were actually attempts to rescue companies which had connections with the Government, {{Lim}} proposed that a commission be established to handle the task. "If bailing-out is to become a government policy, set up this commission where everyone can submit their applications for them to be vetted fairly, regardless of whether they are big or small companies, with or without connections." {{Lim}} also questioned Ekran Bhd's move in using proceeds from a rights issue although it differed from the original intended purpose, saying the case would be a test to the performance of the regulatory authorities. The Opposition leader said he did not object to the amendments but hoped the additional powers would not be used to silence NGOs from criticising government policies or actions. {{Husni Hanadzlah}} hoped the proposed amendments would enhance the responsibility of the board of directors towards shareholders and ensure non-abuse of power. On audit committees, the MP said a study should be conducted to ensure all public companies adhered to the regulation to hold audit committee meetings four times a year. {{Husni Hanadzlah}} said the amendment would also ensure the authenticity of documents filed or lodged by the Registrar. {{Husni Hanadzlah}} praised the move to enable documents required under the Act to be electronically filed or lodged with the Registrar but said the information provided must not be outdated. In lauding the proposed amendments, Michael Lisa Kaya (BN - Bukit Mas) said the proposed inclusion of Section 11(a) was a good move in keeping abreast of national development and the Government's aspirations in information technology. The proposed amendment would see the insertion of this section for electronic filing of documents. The Registrar may provide a service for the electronic filing or lodging of documents. The MP said NGOs would be prevented from misleading the public and causing disharmony with the introduction of the amendment. Citing {{Sahabat Alam Malaysia}}, the MP questioned its motives in playing a role in the setting up of human blockades in Sarawak in 1991. "Instead of inciting the natives, why don't they just educate them by holding seminars," {{Sahabat Alam Malaysia}} asked. For more than two weeks, {{Sahabat Alam Malaysia}} added, the people suffered by participating in the blockades instead of cultivating their land. Mentakab MP Fu Ah Kiow also supported the proposed amendment to introduce electronic filing and said this would help in streamlining the efficiency of the ROC's documentation process. {{M. Kulasegaran}} raised the issue of golf clubs which offered transferable memberships, citing the Kelab Golf Darul Ridzuan in Perak as an example. {{M. Kulasegaran}} said the club, formerly known as the Meru Valley Golf Club, had also offered lots priced at between RM120,000 and RM150,000 each. Local members were charged monthly fees while it was waived for international members. {{M. Kulasegaran}} urged the ROC to conduct stringent inspections over such clubs nationwide. {{Datuk S. Subramaniam}} will wind-up the debate on Wednesday.
