MINNEAPOLIS _ With a smiling, joyous performance that bore none of the caution she displayed at the Nagano Olympics, {{Michelle Kwan}} decisively won the women's short program Friday at the world figure skating championships. On an otherwise inelegant afternoon, when only four of the 30 skaters delivered clean programs, {{Michelle Kwan}} received a perfect mark of 6 for artistry from the Canadian judge. Inexplicably, one judge placed {{Michelle Kwan}} second, but the other eight placed {{Michelle Kwan}} where {{Michelle Kwan}} clearly belonged _ in first, over Anna Rechnio of Poland and Laetitia Hubert of France. Skating to a Rachmaninoff piano trio and concerto, Kwan showed none of the deliberateness that cost {{Michelle Kwan}} a gold medal at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, in February. {{Michelle Kwan}} was elegant, confident and fast on Friday, with exquisite position and flow in {{Michelle Kwan}} triple lutz-double toe combination and with a graceful, extended spiral that drew customary applause from the audience at the Target Center. {{Michelle Kwan}} wobbled slightly upon landing {{Michelle Kwan}} double axel, but otherwise {{Michelle Kwan}} was at {{Michelle Kwan}} self-assured best. {{Tara Lipinski}}, the Olympic gold medalist, was absent, having withdrawn with sickness and fatigue. But {{Tara Lipinski}} had not defeated Kwan in a short program this season, and it was unlikely that {{Tara Lipinski}} could have prevailed Friday. "Knowing that the world championships were in {{Michelle Kwan}} home country meant a lot," said {{Michelle Kwan}}, who is 17 and lives in Lake Arrowhead, Calif. "When {{Michelle Kwan}} stepped on the ice, {{Michelle Kwan}} saw the American flags and the banners and {{Michelle Kwan}} wanted to give the audience the joy and freedom that {{Michelle Kwan}} have on the ice." Saturday's long program will be worth two-thirds of the scoring. {{Michelle Kwan}} is a heavy favorite to win {{Michelle Kwan}} second world title. {{Anna Rechnio}} are {{Anna Rechnio}}itia Hubert}}, who finished 19th and 20th, respectively, at the Olympics. {{Anna Rechnio}}, 20, did not even qualify for the previous two world championships, where {{Anna Rechnio}} best career finish is 14th. {{Anna Rechnio}} had trained for several seasons in Marlboro, Mass., but this season {{Anna Rechnio}} returned to Warsaw, changed coaches, got injured and missed the European championships. Now healthy, {{Anna Rechnio}} landed spectacular jumps Friday and vaulted into second place. {{Laetitia Hubert}}, 23, is {{Laetitia Hubert}}. At the 1992 Winter Games in {{Anna Rechnio}} native France, {{Anna Rechnio}} fell a half-dozen times in the long program and was nicknamed "The Human Zamboni." At the Nagano Games, {{Anna Rechnio}} became so deflated with {{Anna Rechnio}} poor jumping that {{Anna Rechnio}} appeared on the verge of stopping in the middle of {{Anna Rechnio}} long program. But {{Anna Rechnio}} also defeated {{Tara Lipinski}} at Trophy Lalique in Paris last November. Friday, {{Laetitia Hubert}} was one of only two skaters to land a triple-triple combination. {{Julianna Beke}}, the Hungarian judge, even placed {{Julianna Beke}} first, ahead of {{Michelle Kwan}}. {{Michelle Kwan}} only problem came in the draw for Saturday's long program. {{Michelle Kwan}} drew first in the final group of skaters, which {{Michelle Kwan}} had done at the Winter Olympics. "We'll have to go home and work on that," {{Michelle Kwan}} said with a laugh.
