TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia and Turkey signed an accord on Saturday launching a cooperative project to transport oil from Azerbaijan's Caspian oil fields across Georgia to Turkey. Five oil-producing countries of the Caspian Sea region had approved the route earlier this month. The agreement, which will include the construction of a Trans-Caucasian pipeline, was signed Saturday by Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze and Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz of Turkey. Turkey has long campaigned for a pipeline running from Azerbaijan's capital Baku through Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. Turkey's strongest competitor is Russia, which has been vying for pipelines to traverse its territory as well. The first oil from Azerbaijan started flowing through a Russian pipeline last fall. On Friday, Georgia and Turkey signed inter-governmental accords on border cooperation in the Black Sea and exchange programs in sport, education, science and culture, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
