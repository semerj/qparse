{{Clinton}} warned in unusually explicit terms Friday that Japan must change course if it hopes to pull its economy out of a long-running decline that has worsened markedly in recent weeks. {{Clinton}} made {{Clinton}} comments as evidence mounted that Japan, already languishing in recession, is headed into one of its worst downturns since the end of World War II, and the yen fell to a six-and-a-half-year low against the dollar. While {{Clinton}} issued {{Clinton}} warning to Japan in response to a question at a news conference, {{Clinton}} was clearly ready to send a strong message, saying, "You simply can't stay with a strategy that is clearly not appropriate to the times and expect it to get the results that are needed for the country." For months U.S. officials have become increasingly specific about what they believe Japan must do, advocating huge tax cuts and old-fashioned deficit spending to spur an economy that many experts say could shrink by 2 percent this year. The president was careful to praise {{Ryutaro Hashimoto}}, {{Ryutaro Hashimoto}}, as "an able man," but he said there was clearly "an ongoing struggle" with an entrenched bureaucracy. His comments stepped up the recent public pressure from Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and leaders from several of the world's biggest economic powers, who have said repeatedly that Japan's economic decline and its inability to absorb imports from neighboring countries threaten to undermine Asia's fragile recovery. U.S. officials have a more specific concern: the risk that a collapse of more major Japanese banks and securities dealers could imperil Wall Street, just as the Dow Jones Industrial Average crossed 9,000 for the first time. That is hardly a foregone conclusion. But U.S. companies are already reporting that their exports to Asia are dropping drastically, and a collapse in Japan, many say, could start a new round of economic contagion that could reach further than the crises in Southeast Asia and South Korea. Administration officials made clear that {{Clinton}} comments Friday had been carefully planned. "{{Clinton}}'s been building to this for a long time," one senior official said. "We're looking at an economic actor, the world's second-largest economy, whose decisions affect the globe, and there is a growing sense that they are not up to the task, that they do not understand the gravity of the situation for Japan and the rest of the world. There is simply a loss of confidence." On Thursday the chairman of Sony Corp., {{Norio Ohga}}, a man not given to alarmist statements, warned that Japan's economy "is on the verge of collapsing." He compared {{Ryutaro Hashimoto}} to {{Hoover}} in the United States. "If you look at what {{Hoover}} was saying at the start of the Great Depression and what Hashimoto is saying at the moment, they are very similar," {{Norio Ohga}} warned. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> But the sharp reactions in Japan's stock and currency markets seem to have been driven by two different events. The first was the end of the Japanese fiscal year on Tuesday. For days before that deadline, the Japanese government was investing heavily in the country's stock market, trying to boost the price of stocks held by Japan's banks, which are burdened with hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debts. The goal was to make year-end balance sheets appear far sounder than they really were, so banks would meet international requirements for lending around the world. But the stock prices never rose as far as Japanese officials had hoped, and as soon as the deadline passed, prices dropped steeply. The second alarm came from Moody's Investors Service, one of the world's leading financial rating agencies, which issued an unusual warning about Japan on Friday. While Moody's did not drop the Japanese government's triple-A rating, the highest it grants to any country, it altered its outlook to "negative." Although there is virtually no fear that Japan could default on its government debt _ the country has hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves _ the warning made investors who fear rising bankruptcies extremely skittish. The United States has been warning Japan to take far stronger economic action for more than 18 months now. A year ago, when Hashimoto visited the White House, he made a detailed economic presentation to {{Clinton}}, Vice President Al Gore and top economic officials, arguing that a 3 percent tax increase that Japan was imposing would not send the economy into a tailspin. He was wrong. In November, Hashimoto admitted that the tax increase, which had been pressed by bureaucrats in Japan's Finance Ministry, had been a major mistake. But he has not moved to repeal the tax, and so far the economic programs he has announced to spur the economy have been a murky mixture of new and previously announced ones. {{Kunihiko Saito}}, {{Kunihiko Saito}}, said Friday that {{Kunihiko Saito}} had no problem with the mounting pressure from {{Clinton}}. "We Japanese now realize that the old system that worked in the past doesn't work anymore," {{Kunihiko Saito}} said Friday. "We have to reform ourselves, and change our system." But, he added, "Sometimes public statements can be counterproductive, and we have been asking U.S. officials to be careful in their public statements."
