QUEEN OF IT ALL

The store's name, Samiramis, comes from an Assyrian queen known for beauty and bravery. But it also plays on the name of the original owner, Samir Koury, who immigrated from Ramallah in 1953. In 1962,  Koury opened a nearby liquor store and created an Arabic radio show. He started the grocery in 1972.

BY ANY NAME

For decades, hummus was the store's most popular item. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first English citation for hummus was in 1955. As with many Arabic translations, romanized spellings for the chickpea spread (hommos and humos, among others) vary. "When I started out, no one knew the word. Now you can buy it at Costco,"  Koury said.

WORLD CHANGES

Koury sold the store and retired in November. The new manager,  Imseeh, a 24-year-old accountant, also from the West Bank, easily reels off dozens of prices to a stream of shoppers. "We love the same foods,"  Imseeh said. He has also brought in a range of organic products. In the early years,  Koury made foraging trips to Egypt, Syria and Jordan twice a year. Now importing from the first two is much more complicated.

IMPORTED TASTES

Water pipes — also known as hookahs, nargilehs or shishas — are sold for smoking flavored tobaccos, a popular social ritual in the Middle East. A recent study of American college students found more than 40 percent had tried it. Another study showed a 40 percent increase in adult use in California. A hookah costs $20 to $80.

IN WITH THE NEW

A cat named Oxana lived at the store for 10 years and attracted a fan club. When  Koury sold the store, the cat stayed but soon disappeared.  Imseeh searched for her, but when he couldn't find her, he brought home Bella, a shy kitten.
