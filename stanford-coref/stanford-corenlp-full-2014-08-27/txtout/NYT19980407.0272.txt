NEW YORK _ {{Werner Herzog}} tells a real-life tall tale in "Little Dieter Needs To Fly," a documentary that describes enough breakneck adventures for any action hero. But the swashbuckler who is the film's subject, {{Dieter Dengler}}, mostly describes his exploits from memory. Now a garrulous extrovert living a comfortable life near San Francisco, he talks of extraordinary early hardship and of the drive that sustained him. With a German childhood seared by images of World War II, and with an American military career that saw him shot down over Laos in 1966, he has many a hair-raising story to tell. But as often happens in {{Werner Herzog}} haunting documentaries, the most interesting figure seems to be the one behind the camera. Though {{Dieter Dengler}} is a practiced raconteur and has {{Dieter Dengler}} story amply illustrated here, it is {{Werner Herzog}} occasional meditations on {{Dieter Dengler}} subject that linger. "As a child," the filmmaker says in voice-over, "{{Dieter Dengler}} saw things that made no earthly sense at all. Germany had been transformed into a dreamscape of the surreal." Starkly poetic images of wartime destruction accompany that observation. Aerial shots of voluptuous explosions in the jungle amplify {{Werner Herzog}} idea of what it must have been like for {{Dieter Dengler}} to be a fighter pilot: "It all looked strange, like a barbaric dream." "Little Dieter Needs to Fly," which opens on Wednesday at the Film Forum, is one of the filmmaker's least exotic works, but it straightforwardly presents {{Dieter Dengler}} eventful history. {{Dieter Dengler}} speaks of having, as a boy, torn wallpaper off bombed-out walls so that {{Dieter Dengler}} mother could cook it, since there were nutrients in the glue. {{Dieter Dengler}} shows the camera how, even now, memories of being in a prisoner-of-war camp lead {{Dieter Dengler}} to keep hundreds of pounds of emergency provisions hidden under {{Dieter Dengler}} house, just in case. Returning to Southeast Asia with a camera crew ({{Werner Herzog}} enlists villagers and water buffalo to stand impassively before the camera and provide atmosphere), {{Dieter Dengler}} describes {{Werner Herzog}} harrowing experiences as a prisoner. "They were just always thinking of something to do to {{Werner Herzog}}," {{Werner Herzog}} says of {{Werner Herzog}} captors, from whom {{Werner Herzog}} ultimately made a highly dramatic escape. {{Dieter Dengler}} illustrates how to open handcuffs with a piece of wire, tells of biting a snake in two, even shares a black-tie reunion dinner with the helicopter pilot who finally rescued {{Dieter Dengler}}. And in light of {{Dieter Dengler}} many ordeals, {{Dieter Dengler}} pleasant chattiness begins to seem the film's strangest aspect. As {{Werner Herzog}} puts it: "{{Werner Herzog}} hides behind the casual remark that this was the fun part of {{Werner Herzog}} life."
