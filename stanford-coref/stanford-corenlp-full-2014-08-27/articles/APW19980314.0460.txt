JERUSALEM (AP) _ A man was seriously injured Saturday in an explosion outside the bus station in the small northern Israeli town of Afula, an ambulance official said. The blast blew off both the man's hands, Israeli army radio quoted Eli Bin, deputy head of the Afula ambulance station, as saying. The man appeared to be in his early 50s, the radio said. Police said the explosion took place in a public park just outside the bus station. Before the man was taken into surgery, he said he had spotted a cardboard box that he thought looked suspicious and was examining it when it exploded, army radio said. Israeli police frequently tell people to be on the alert for suspicious objects that might be bombs planted by Palestinian militant groups. However, police always urge the public not to touch any such objects, but to report them to the nearest police station. The Afula bus station was the scene of a major terror attack in April 1994, when a car rigged with explosives blew up, killing nine people and injuring 45. The militant Muslim group Hamas claimed responsibility. When Saturday's blast occurred, however, the bus station was nearly deserted. There is no public transport in most Israeli cities on the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday.
