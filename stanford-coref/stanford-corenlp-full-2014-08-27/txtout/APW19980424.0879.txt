MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia and Switzerland signed an agreement Friday pledging to combine efforts to prevent Russian organized crime from laundering profits in Swiss banks. The memorandum, signed in Moscow by Swiss Federal Prosecutor {{Carla del Ponte}} and Russian Prosecutor General {{Yuri Skuratov}}, calls for sharing information about organized crime suspects and about banks involved in laundering or accepting deposits of illegal profits. There have been frequent reports that Russian organized crime uses Swiss banks to launder criminal profits running to hundreds of millions of dollars. The activity apparently thrives in the Lake Geneva area, where the Russians buy up property and run prostitution rackets. Last year, del {{Carla del Ponte}} and {{Yuri Skuratov}} agreed to step up efforts in fighting organized crime, but the memorandum signed Friday was the first official agreement between the two nations' law-enforcement agencies, {{Yuri Skuratov}} said. "{{Yuri Skuratov}} believe that we have made a very important step toward raising a solid barrier against organized crime," {{Yuri Skuratov}} told reporters after the signing. Nobody knows exactly how much Russian crime money is being kept in Switzerland, and figuring that out is one of the goals of the new agreement, del {{Carla del Ponte}} and {{Yuri Skuratov}} said at a joint news conference. "If {{Carla del Ponte}} knew that, {{Carla del Ponte}} would be a very happy lawyer," {{Carla del Ponte}} told reporters. "Switzerland is above all interested in getting Russia's information on people suspected in laundering money in Switzerland," {{Carla del Ponte}} said. The sides also agreed to form a joint task force to investigate organized crime activities, share information and analyze the crime situation in the two countries, {{Yuri Skuratov}} said. {{Carla del Ponte}} also said that Swiss police has completed the investigation of the case against one of top reputed Russian mafia bosses, {{Sergei Mikhailov}}, who was arrested in Geneva in October, 1996, after warrants were issued in the United States, Israel and Belgium. {{Sergei Mikhailov}} is charged with involvement in organized crime and money laundering. The case will soon be brought to trial, {{Carla del Ponte}} said. (ad/jai)
