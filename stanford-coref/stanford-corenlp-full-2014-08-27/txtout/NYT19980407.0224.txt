CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, they are working on a project they call "the last book." This may sound ominous to book lovers. After all, the Media Lab devotes itself mainly to computers. Looking at a computer means reading an electronic screen, which is decidedly not the way most people want to read a book, particularly the last one. Reading text on a computer screen is confining and tiresome. You can't see where you are or how far you have to go. You can't leaf through the pages to compare parts of the text or to see what your eye finds at random. You can't comfortably carry a computer screen around with you, to bed, to the beach or to the bathroom. You can't collect computer screens, or bind them beautifully in vellum, or display them on shelves in the spirit that the English novelist Anthony Powell evoked when he titled one of his volumes "Books Do Furnish a Room." But hold everything! The news is far from grim. The book of the future described to me on a visit to the Media Lab is really a book, just like "Goodnight Moon," "Paradise Lost" or the Gutenberg Bible. It has a binding that could be made of leather if you wanted, and hundreds of pages you can turn one at a time or riffle through. You'll be able to carry it around with you, to bed, to the beach or to the bathroom. The key to this book is something called electronic ink, or e-ink, which can be applied to the page from within instead of by a press. Being developed by {{Joseph Jacobson}}, {{Joseph Jacobson}} at MIT, with the backing of Things That Think and News in the Future, two business consortia of some 75 companies, this e-ink consists of microscopic spheres, each about 40 microns in diameter, or about half the thickness of a piece of paper. Each sphere is half black and half white. These spheres can be applied by the millions to paper and then flipped over electronically to either their black sides or their white sides to produce what looks like a traditional printed page. As envisioned at the Media Lab, the book pages will each have fine wires carrying electricity to flip the dots in the direction of a computer concealed in the book binding. The user will scroll through a list of book titles displayed on the book's spine. If the user selects "Ulysses," the computer will make the text appear on the book's pages by flipping the appropriate spheres to their black or white sides. As the capacity of the book's memory grows, whole libraries may be installed. {{Joseph Jacobson}} foresees being able to store the entire U.S. Library of Congress, whose holdings number more than 17 million volumes. A user might also be able to assemble a book from multiple sources to fit special needs. Illustrations might be animated. E-ink could also make it possible to receive broadcasts that typeset themselves to create instant newspaper. Yet the book would still have the familiar advantages of a book, {{Joseph Jacobson}} says. You could unplug its power and carry it anywhere. The display would be designed to sense the presence of a stylus, or pen, so that you could underline or write notes on it. You might even be able to dogear the book. {{Joseph Jacobson}} greatly admires the traditional book. "After all," {{Joseph Jacobson}} added, "if books had been invented after the computer, they would have been considered a big breakthrough. Books have several hundred simultaneous paper-thin, flexible displays. They boot instantly. They run on very low power at a very low cost." <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> Every book ever published in a single volume? The mind boggles and a dozen questions form. Will this really happen? How soon could the last book be available? "A prototype with just a few pages could be put together in two to three years, with one of 400 pages taking a year or two longer," {{Joseph Jacobson}} said. (It should be pointed out that two years ago, in a description of {{Joseph Jacobson}} project published by the Media Lab, {{Joseph Jacobson}} stated that a prototype would be available in "about two years," meaning 1998. What I actually saw at the Media Lab did not approach even one page.) "We have already demonstrated the fundamental new parts needed to make it," {{Joseph Jacobson}} continued. "Since there are many different projects that can be enabled by this underpinning technology, exactly when it will be combined to form a book is not yet clear. But an important point is that these are technologies that are easily manufactured and not phenomenally expensive." How much will it cost then? {{Joseph Jacobson}} says the volume will probably retail for $2 to $4 per reusable page, or $500 to $1,000 for a book that is every book, although {{Joseph Jacobson}} is working on ways to reduce costs even further. "It would be nice to have a cost so low that you could lose the book without worrying about it too much," {{Joseph Jacobson}} added. "{{Joseph Jacobson}} believe that will be possible." What about the cost of the contents? Books in the public domain could be downloaded for nothing, {{Joseph Jacobson}} says. For new works and books still in copyright, a system of royalties could be set up in which texts would be encrypted and readers would buy the access code by Internet, phone or wireless transaction. Some questions remain unanswered. What are the implications for the publishing industry? Already any writer can post a book on the Internet. But books will still need to be edited and promoted. What about libraries? Bookstores? Remainders? Used books? First editions? Rare books? Copies inscribed by the author? Autographing parties? What, in heaven's name, is to become of the dearly beloved book borrower? Will books no longer furnish a room? It looks as if they won't, unless, like me, you will still insist on having certain titles on the shelf, to remind you of their existence and your promise to yourself to read them some day. The likes of us will have to keep on collecting old-fashioned books. Or maybe resort to displaying those Potemkin villages of books on our shelves, rows and rows of our favorite titles in colors that match the furniture and the pets. Just one of them will be real and removable from the shelf. It will contain not hollowed-out pages with a gun or a whisky flask or cash or diamonds, but a treasure far greater: at the touch of a button, any book ever written. And when it is removed, family members will be free to ask a question that might once have reflected a certain benightedness: "Hey!" they'll be able to cry out. "Who's using the book?"
