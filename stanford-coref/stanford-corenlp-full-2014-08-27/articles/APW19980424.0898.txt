KRASNOYARSK, Russia (AP) _ The candidates for governor of the Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia have employed all the tools available to modern politics: polling, television advertising _ and, apparently, dirty tricks. The election, set for Sunday, has attracted national attention because Russia's former security chief Alexander Lebed is one of the candidates. Russian news agencies reported Friday that police had confiscated 850,000 copies of a newspaper published by Lebed's campaign because it allegedly contained libelous material about his chief rival, incumbent Gov. Valery Zubov. Lebed called the charge "absurd," and said unspecified rivals had been carrying out dirty tricks against his campaign, including having someone hand out condoms to young schoolchildren in Lebed's name. The Lebed newspaper, Krasnoyarski Krai, was confiscated on Wednesday from a printing plant, authorities said. Local television showed copies of the newspaper and the offending article, headlined "Look out, Provocation!" The article declared that Zubov was considering acts of vandalism, including "accidents at the power stations, the cutting off of electricity, water, transportation, communications... to provoke dissatisfaction of the populace and to cause panic." A Zubov campaign spokesman, Yuri Vasliev, declined to comment on the article Friday, except to say that the matter needed to be settled in court. Lebed, in an interview with The Associated Press, denied any knowledge of the article and said there had been no justification for seizing the newspapers. "I think it is the activity of the governor," he said. He went on to say that there had been numerous dirty tricks played on his campaign. "I am categorically against these dirty tricks," he said. "I am eager to increase positive things." (ml/gm)
