MOSCOW _ In a meeting that was as much political theater as substance, {{Boris Yeltsin}} summoned {{Boris Yeltsin}} opponents to the Kremlin Tuesday in an attempt to show that {{Boris Yeltsin}} has a steady grip on the reins of power and to drum up support for {{Boris Yeltsin}} new prime minister. The much ballyhooed political round table took place in the ornate St. Catherine Hall. The president held center stage while {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}, {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}, sat by {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} side. The television cameras captured {{Boris Yeltsin}} as {{Boris Yeltsin}} served notice to {{Boris Yeltsin}} critics that {{Boris Yeltsin}} had no intention of abandoning {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. After projecting an image of strength, {{Boris Yeltsin}} portrayed {{Boris Yeltsin}} as a reasonable leader who would try to work with the Communist -dominated lower house of parliament. But the meeting itself was something less than definitive. After the two-hour session ended, the back-room negotiating over the {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} nomination went on. "{{Yevgeny Volk}} think it was a purely cosmetic event," said {{Yevgeny Volk}}. "What we are talking about is bargaining. In tactical terms, {{Boris Yeltsin}} conducted a round table so that the Communists and nationals could say their pressure on the government had been answered." {{Yevgeny Volk}}, however, expressed the dominant view in Moscow that {{Boris Yeltsin}} would ultimately succeed in winning parliamentary approval of {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. Indeed, the key question increasingly appears to be not whether {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} will be approved but what the cost will be in terms of symbolic or substantive concessions by Yeltsin in new appointments or programs. To be sure, {{Boris Yeltsin}} was not the only one striking poses. {{Gennadi Zyuganov}}, {{Gennadi Zyuganov}}, declared after the meeting that the Communists would not back {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} when his nomination comes before Parliament on Friday. But that does not mean that the Communists are determined to block the nomination indefinitely. Many political analysts believe that the Communists are determined to appear resolute before a national day of protest scheduled for Thursday. And {{Gennadi Zyuganov}} was careful not to exclude the possibility that the Communists might eventually acquiesce in the nomination. {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}}, {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}}, said {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}} would back {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} only on the condition that {{Vladimir Zhirinovsky}} could pick some of the members of {{Boris Yeltsin}}. {{Alexander Shokhin}}, {{Alexander Shokhin}}, also suggested {{Alexander Shokhin}} party should influence the composition of {{Boris Yeltsin}} new team. {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} was the most adamant in the opposition to {{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} appears to be calculating that the influence of {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} Yablocko Party will increase if {{Grigory Yavlinsky}} remains unambiguously in the opposition or if {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} falls by the wayside. The Parliament's first vote on the {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} nomination is expected on Friday. Even if the Parliament rebuffs {{Boris Yeltsin}}, the president has indicated {{Boris Yeltsin}} will press again for the Parliament's approval and {{Boris Yeltsin}} has considerable leverage. <ANNOTATION> (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) </ANNOTATION> If the Parliament rejects {{Boris Yeltsin}} choice for prime minister three times, the president can disband the parliament and call for new parliamentary elections. Many parliamentary deputies are loath to compete in such early elections and prefer to hold on their posts and privileges as long as possible. But Tuesday's meeting was designed to avoid a confrontation. During the session, {{Boris Yeltsin}} said {{Boris Yeltsin}} had considered several other choices, including Yegor Stroyev, the head of the upper house of parliament and Moscow major Yuri Luzhkov, before settling on the 35-year -{{Sergei Kiriyenko}}. {{Boris Yeltsin}} praised {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} professionalism and said that {{Boris Yeltsin}} could include candidates from opposing factions. {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} is to propose a list over the next week of officials that would serve in {{Boris Yeltsin}}. {{Boris Yeltsin}} grandly declared that 1998 should be "a year without confrontation," overlooking the fact that {{Boris Yeltsin}} had not bothered to consult the parliament of most of {{Boris Yeltsin}} own government before picking {{Sergei Kiriyenko}} and ordering {{Boris Yeltsin}} surprise government shake-up" "{{Boris Yeltsin}} will not veto your decisions and you should abstain from bans," {{Boris Yeltsin}} said. "Let's try to get along this way."
