NEW YORK _ {{Eyad Ismoil}}, {{Eyad Ismoil}}, was sentenced on Friday to 240 years in prison. In handing down the sentence, Judge Kevin T. Duffy of U.S. District Court in Manhattan rejected {{Eyad Ismoil}} that he had not received a fair trial, as well as his lawyer's argument that {{Eyad Ismoil}} was not {{Eyad Ismoil}}ef}}, who was convicted along with him in November. "What you did was a sneak attack," Duffy said. "What you did was to kill innocents. What you sought to do was to kill innocents." The judge also imposed a $250,000 fine, and ordered {{Eyad Ismoil}} to pay $10 million in restitution _ "just to make sure that you never make a dime out of this," he said. During the proceeding, {{Eyad Ismoil}}, the last of six defendants convicted of carrying out the bombing plot, continued to assert {{Eyad Ismoil}} innocence. "Jail {{Eyad Ismoil}}, and you will add one number to the wrong list," {{Eyad Ismoil}} said. "But don't think that you will ever rest, because tyrants always end up in trouble." He said that the charges were false and that they would "fade like a bubble." "In this world," he said, "a fair trial is always rare." The judge dismissed {{Eyad Ismoil}}. "You have received an extraordinarily fair trial, something which was done not as a show trial but to give you the opportunity to put forward whatever you wanted to do," he said. Under the rules of the federal system, {{Eyad Ismoil}} will not be eligible for parole, and is likely to spend the rest of {{Eyad Ismoil}} life in prison. {{Eyad Ismoil}} sentence matches the 240-year -terms imposed on the five other men convicted in the bombing. The U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Mary Jo White, whose office prosecuted the case, said the sentence "once again sends a clear message that this country will respond to terrorist acts with the full force of the law." {{Eyad Ismoil}} did not testify in the trial, but {{Louis R. Aidala}}, {{Louis R. Aidala}}, often sought to distance {{Louis R. Aidala}} client from {{Ramzi Yousef}}, portraying {{Louis R. Aidala}} as a naive 21-year -old Jordanian who came to the United States to get an education and a job, and got swept into the conspiracy. {{Eyad Ismoil}} said there was no evidence that {{Eyad Ismoil}} was a religious or political fanatic, like {{Ramzi Yousef}}. Prosecutors said {{Eyad Ismoil}} was working in Texas when {{Eyad Ismoil}} was called by {{Ramzi Yousef}} and asked to help in the plot. {{Eyad Ismoil}} told authorities after {{Eyad Ismoil}} arrest that {{Eyad Ismoil}} believed {{Eyad Ismoil}} was transporting boxes of soap into the World Trade Center garage as part of a business deal, the jury was told. During Friday's proceeding, {{Louis R. Aidala}} again questioned whether there was sufficient evidence that {{Eyad Ismoil}} knew {{Eyad Ismoil}} was participating in a bombing. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelley argued that the jury had made fair conclusions from the circumstantial evidence. The judge agreed and then echoed statements that he had made in {{Ramzi Yousef}} in January, when he said that the convicted terrorist had worshiped the god of "death and destruction." "You were like {{Ramzi Yousef}} because your god was evil," the judge told Ismoil on Friday. "I am not talking about an evil god; I am talking about the personification of evil."
