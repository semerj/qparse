JERUSALEM (AP) _ A man was injured Saturday in an explosion at the bus station in the small northern Israeli town of Afula, police said. Israel radio said the man's injuries were serious. He was seen handling a cardboard box when there was a sudden explosion, injuring his hands and eyes, the radio said. The man was taken to a hospital and the police were investigating. No further details were immediately available. The Afula bus station was the scene of a major terror attack in April 1994, when a car rigged with explosives blew up, killing nine people and injuring 45. The militant Muslim group Hamas claimed responsibility. When Saturday's blast occurred, however, the station was almost deserted. There is no public transport in most Israeli cities on the Jewish Sabbath, which begins at sundown Friday and ends at sundown on Saturday.
