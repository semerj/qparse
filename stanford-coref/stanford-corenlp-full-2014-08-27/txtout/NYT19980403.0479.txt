WASHINGTON _ If {{Paula Jones}} decides to appeal the ruling throwing out {{Paula Jones}} lawsuit against President {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}, {{Paula Jones}} case will go before a generally conservative circuit court in St. Louis, with a record that could cut both ways for {{Paula Jones}} case. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, legal experts say, has not only been consistently unhelpful to {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}, but it has also been generally hostile to complaints of sexual discrimination at the workplace like the one brought by {{Paula Jones}}. {{Paula Jones}} lawyers said Friday that the decision on whether to appeal the case rests solely with {{Paula Jones}} and will probably be made next week. {{Paula Jones}} must appeal within 30 days from Wednesday, the day when Judge Susan Webber Wright dismissed the sexual misconduct case. Ms. Wright rejected all of the claims stemming from what {{Paula Jones}} said was a 1991 encounter with Clinton in a Little Rock, Ark., hotel suite. The judge said that even if {{Paula Jones}} assertion that {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} made a crude sexual advance in the suite was true, there was no evidence that it constituted sexual harassment. {{Lynne Bernabei}}, a lawyer based in Washington who specializes in sexual harassment cases, said {{Lynne Bernabei}} believed that Ms. Wright left little room for an appeal, adding that it was unlikely the ruling would be overturned. "The fact that the judge gave {{Paula Jones}} side so much leeway in discovery proceedings to prove their case will make it that much harder to overturn," {{Lynne Bernabei}} said. Other legal experts said the 8th Circuit judges had created a strong record in favor of defendants in employment discrimination cases, which is {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} role in this case. "Given that this circuit has been trying to cut back on the ease with which people can bring these suits, you could say this would be an easy case to affirm," said {{Roger Goldman}}, {{Roger Goldman}}. "But if you look at the political side of things, that would cut in the other direction. Almost all the judges who are not recused on this matter were appointed by either Bush or {{Ronald Reagan}} and to the extent that politics makes a difference, that would cut in the other direction." {{Roger Goldman}} was referring to the fact that just three of the 10 active judges on the appeals court have been appointed by Democratic presidents, and two of the three have made it known they would not participate in any cases involving {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}. A similar view to {{Roger Goldman}} was offered by {{Leland Ware}}. "The 8th Circuit has been pretty rigorous about affirming summary-judgment rulings in employment discrimination cases," {{Leland Ware}} said in an interview. "This is a defendant-friendly circuit in these kinds of cases." But he said many lawyers who practice before the 8th Circuit believed that its judges were not favorably disposed toward {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}}. "That's what makes this such an interesting call," he said. Among the cases {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} has lost before the 8th Circuit was one in which a three-judge panel overruled Ms. Wright in January 1996. In a 2 - 1 ruling, that panel said the {{Paula Jones}} lawsuit should not be delayed until the end of {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} tenure as president, and ordered the case to go forward. Its decision was upheld by a unanimous Supreme Court. In April 1997, another panel voted 2 - 1 against the White House when it said that notes taken by government lawyers of their conversations with {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} could not be withheld from {{Kenneth Starr}}, {{Kenneth Starr}}. And in a third case, in March 1996, a unanimous three-judge panel ruled in favor of {{Kenneth Starr}} expanding {{Kenneth Starr}} investigation and took the unusual step of removing the lower-court judge from the case because he had spoken of his admiration for {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} and had spent a night as a guest at the {{Hillary Rodham Clinton}} White House. Judge {{Pasco Bowman II}}, who was appointed by {{Ronald Reagan}}, was {{Pasco Bowman II}}. {{Pasco Bowman II}} was also {{Pasco Bowman II}} that overruled Ms. Wright in 1996, and that panel could inherit any appeal from {{Paula Jones}}. Court officials said that if for some reason the same panel did not hear the {{Paula Jones}} case, the clerk would then be obliged to choose a new three-judge panel by lottery. In any event, the appeals court could not hear arguments in the case until next fall at the earliest, some court officials said Friday.
