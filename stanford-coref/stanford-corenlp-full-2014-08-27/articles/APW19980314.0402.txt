OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Russia's Alexey Prokurorov had no real challengers as he won the 50-kilometer classical-style cross country World Cup race in Holmenkollen Saturday, clocking 2 hours, 32 minutes, 25.3 seconds. Four Norwegians chased behind, but Odd Bjorn Hjelmeseth, Bjorn Dahlie, Anders Aukland and Erling Jevne had to settle with second to fifth places. Prokurorov was 1:18.9 ahead of Hjelmeseth. Thomas Alsgaard of Norway clinched the World Cup Wednesday in Sweden and he had nothing to go for in the 50K, finishing 20th. He had 801 points in the final overall standings.
