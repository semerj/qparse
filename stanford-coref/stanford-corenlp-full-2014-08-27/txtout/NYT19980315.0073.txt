HOLLYWOOD _ Ask the top talent agents in Hollywood or studio executives or producers for the name of the biggest star in town. It's not {{Tom Cruise}}. The answer is one word: Leo. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} _ the few who know {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} and the many who pretend to know {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} call the actor {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is not only Hollywood's hottest star as a result of "Titanic" and "The Man in the Iron Mask" but, by all accounts, the biggest star to have emerged in years. "{{Sherry Lansing}}'ve never seen a frenzy like this," said {{Sherry Lansing}}, {{Sherry Lansing}}, which jointly financed "Titanic" with 20th Century Fox. "{{Sherry Lansing}} don't know what to relate it to _ the Beatles, {{Elvis}}, Frank Sinatra in {{Elvis}} heyday. The frenzy is not just about his looks but his talent." The blond 23-year -old actor, whose androgynous good looks make him seem almost like a teen-ager (which is part of his appeal to young girls), is, of course, the co-star with {{Kate Winslet}}. The film has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, a box-office record, and was in a dead heat last weekend to remain in the No. 1 spot with "The Man in the Iron Mask," a remake by {{Randall Wallace}} and his brother, Philippe. Both films grossed an estimated $17.5 million. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} rapid rise to stardom is underscored by {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} financial demands. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} signed on to "Titanic" for a reported $2.5 million. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} earned about $6 million for "The Man in the Iron Mask," made by United Artists, a division of MGM. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} demands for a studio film are now in the $20 million range, placing {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} on par with Cruise, Ford and a handful of others. Yet what seems highly unusual about {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}, in contrast with stars like {{Tom Cruise}}, is that, by all accounts, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is not especially comfortable with, and actually dislikes, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} image as a movie idol, not only in the United States but abroad. Several filmmakers who know {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} said that the star already felt trapped by {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} romantic image among teen-agers and viewed {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} as a serious actor who sought roles with other talented actors and A-list directors. ({{Leonardo DiCaprio}} only other forthcoming role is in a new Woody Allen project, called "Celebrity," to be released later this year.) What's also unusual about {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} does not fall within the tradition of rugged classic stars like Clark Gable, or romantic heroes like Cary Grant, or archetypal American figures like James Stewart, or even character stars like Spencer Tracy, James Cagney or Humphrey Bogart. Instead, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} seems to most resemble Montgomery Clift and James Dean, whose performances were marked by brooding and sensitive roles that especially appealed to teen-agers. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} longevity as a star remains, of course, unknown. In present-day Hollywood, actors are heralded as stars, mostly by the publicity machine, but then fade. Last year Vanity Fair hailed {{Matthew McConaughey}}. But a series of disappointing films have dimmed {{Matthew McConaughey}} stardom. Matt Damon of "Good Will Hunting" is getting a similar star treatment now. Yet {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is seen, somehow, differently. Since {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} teen-age years, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} has been a sought-after actor in Hollywood and viewed as a performer with an unusually broad acting range. "People are confusing {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} looks with {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} talent," remarked Lindsay Doran, president of United Artists. "Look at the Beatles _ it was the power of the music that created the emotion that got all mixed up with how adorable those guys were." {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} earned an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor at 19 for {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} portrayal of a mentally impaired youngster in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape." {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} gained further attention in "This Boy's Life" (1993), a harrowing drama in which {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} played opposite Ellen Barkin and Robert De Niro as the son of an abusive stepfather. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} breakthrough role, though, was in Baz Luhrmann's MTV -style "{{William Shakespeare}}. "With {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} it's charisma, pure and simple, and if you can define what charisma is, tell {{Laura Ziskin}} and {{Laura Ziskin}}'ll bottle it," said {{Laura Ziskin}}, president of Fox 2000, a division of 20th Century Fox. "{{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'s got an amazing gift as an actor, but so do a lot of people. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'s got something else, and only a handful of people have that." {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}, who began making television commercials at 14 and then appeared on the television series "Growing Pains," is almost reclusive and declines most interviews. {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} appeared on NBC's "Today" show last week to promote "The Man in the Iron Mask" and said, "{{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'m {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'m getting tons more opportunities." The fact that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} was not nominated for an Academy Award {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} in contrast with Ms. {{Kate Winslet}} _ was, {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} said, "a non-issue." {{Rick Yorn}}, {{Rick Yorn}} manager at the firm Addis-Wechsler &AMP; Associates, was unavailable. Filmmakers who have worked with {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} have said that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} presence on screen sets {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} apart from other actors. {{Randall Wallace}}, who adapted and directed "The Man in the Iron Mask," said: "Most actors are like most people _ they're actually scared to play roles in which they portray openness and heroism because they have an inherent and usually unspoken fear that to attempt such a role would be to reveal their own inherent shallowness and cowardice. So actors hide behind quirkiness and cynicism. No one would accuse {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}. Cynicism is the last thing that {{Leonardo DiCaprio}}'s about." {{Tom Rothman}}, {{Tom Rothman}}, put in another way: "What {{Randall Wallace}} have in {{Leonardo DiCaprio}} is a gigantic star _ and remember, {{Tom Rothman}}'s {{Tom Rothman}}} in emotionally... {{Randall Wallace}} feel what {{Tom Rothman}} character in 'Titanic' feels. The same with {{William Shakespeare}}. It's not just a question of good looks; there are plenty of good-looking guys out there. On the screen {{William Shakespeare}}'s emotionally accessible. How many actors are like that?"
