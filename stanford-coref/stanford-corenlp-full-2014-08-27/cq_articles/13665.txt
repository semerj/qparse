ECLECTIC EDUCATION

Joseph Nourse worked for the San Francisco school district for 42 years as a teacher, principal and superintendent. In 1919, Nourse started the city's R.O.T.C. program. In 1940, "against his better judgment," he allowed students to play bridge during school. The school had some noteworthy graduates, including Pedro Flores, a former Filipino bellboy credited with marketing the yo-yo.

THE BEAT GOES ON

After the High School of Commerce closed in 1952, the hall was rented out for events. In 1965, Alcoholics Anonymous held a 30th anniversary event there. On the day of Robert F. Kennedy's funeral in 1968, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg read poetry. A year later, Jim Morrison appeared with the Living Theatre, an experimental theater company with nude performers (some on LSD) who proclaimed, "To be free is to be free is to be free."

ABOVE AND BEYOND

Damon Tevis, a facilities administrator for the school district, knows the decorative Spanish Revival-style building inside and out. Climbing on the catwalks in the space above the ceiling, he pointed to hand-cranks for the elaborate chandeliers and to the plaster and horsehair insulation. "There are doors that go nowhere," he said.

WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS

In 1985, the orchestra pit was covered with plywood and used as a courtroom for a State Civil Court case on asbestos exposure, which involved 35 insurance companies and almost 100 lawyers. It was one of the first instances of a "wired" courtroom: lawyers were provided computers linked to a mainframe in Texas to share documents. After the two-year trial, a judge ruled against the insurance companies.

CHIC AND CHEAP

After the court case, the theater was closed to the public and the school district used it for storage. City Arts & Lectures is trying to raise $1 million for cosmetic renovations: seats, carpets and paint. The theater is due to reopen in 2013, and the school board has agreed to rent it for $2,500 per month.
