BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) _ A judge said the government was being too sensitive when it suspended a math teacher for comparing the size of a coin image of President Bakili Muluzi with that of his predecessor in a class exercise. {{Eric Kumitsonyo}} said Thursday that {{Eric Kumitsonyo}} could find "nothing derogatory" in {{Felix Mchamithe}} remark that {{Bakili Muluzi}} image on a coin was larger than that of the late dictator Kamuzu Banda. "Is it not true that {{Bakili Muluzi}} fills the coin? And if it is full, so what?" {{Eric Kumitsonyo}} said. {{Eric Kumitsonyo}} adjourned the hearing and did not indicate when {{Eric Kumitsonyo}} will make a ruling. {{Felix Mchamithe}}, who asked {{Felix Mchamithe}} pupils to measure the images during a lesson on circumference and circles, sued education authorities for wrongful dismissal. {{Felix Mchamithe}} said {{Felix Mchamithe}} was suspended for {{Bakili Muluzi}} and undermining {{Felix Mchamithe}} presidential authority. The teacher told the court that he made it clear in the classroom that {{Kamuzu Banda}}, who died last year at age 99, was {{Kamuzu Banda}}. {{Bakili Muluzi}} ousted Banda in the first democratic elections in 1994, ending {{Kamuzu Banda}} brutal 30-year dictatorship. The new ruling party said it would not copy {{Kamuzu Banda}} habit of putting the president's image on the currency, but {{Bakili Muluzi}} appeared there after two years. Detectives spent eight hours Thursday questioning staff at the opposition Daily Times over remarks it published describing {{Bakili Muluzi}} as "silly," the newspaper reported. The remarks were reportedly made in a speech by an opposition politician who dismissed government accusations that the opposition was sponsoring crime to undermine {{Bakili Muluzi}}.
