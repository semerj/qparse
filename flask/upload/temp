Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, announced on Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday that he had "decided to actively explore the possibility of running for president of the United States."

Mr. Bush has long been viewed as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2016, and he said earlier this month that he would be making a decision "in short order" on whether to run.

The announcement by Mr. Bush does not say he has formed an exploratory committee, just that he will form a leadership PAC in January, which will pull him in line with other potential candidates who have already launched such PACs, like Senators Rand Paul, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. It will also put him ahead of potential rivals like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who has yet to establish any kind of political organization that would ease a path toward a presidential run.

By making official what has been increasingly apparent in recent weeks -- that he's considering a 2016 presidential bid -- Mr. Bush has for the moment frozen the so-called invisible primary.

Mr. Bush's fellow Floridian, Mr. Rubio, will see a significant number of the Republican contributors in their donor-rich state side with the former governor.

Mr. Christie will feel a similar chill from the Republican money class, especially in New York City.

And much of the air is likely to come out of the Mitt 3.0 balloon, as the prospect of a Bush campaign will fill the vacuum that a third Mitt Romney run had temporarily occupied for some party elites.

Then there are the other current governors - Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John Kasich of Ohio, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Rick Perry of Texas - who have expressed interest in a 2016 run. The donors they were seeking commitments from may now choose to either side with Mr. Bush or at least wait to see if he actually runs.

The question that looms over yet another Bush candidacy, though, is if he can appeal to actual Republican primary voters as much as he does the party's wealthy bundlers. Many of Mr. Bush's would-be rivals are skeptical. So for them, Mr. Bush's making such an early move is not entirely bad news. If it turns out that he cannot appeal to the party base or backs away from a run entirely, there will be time for them to make their move.

For now, though, it is Mr. Bush who is the market-mover.
