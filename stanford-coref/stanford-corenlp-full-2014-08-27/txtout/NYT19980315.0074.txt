You've read the book? Now see the television program. Inspired by "{{Angela}}," his {{Frank McCourt}} account of growing up in Depression Ireland, which has become entrenched high on best-seller lists, {{Frank McCourt}} brings together the four {{Frank McCourt}} brothers in an hour of reminiscence and reflection, sing-along and gab about growing up in the lanes of Limerick. Admirers of "{{Angela}}" will not be surprised to discover that the brothers' memories are at best bittersweet. Given the miseries of their youth _ hunger and filth, early deaths and family disarray _ the wonder is that these "laners," the poorest of Ireland's poor, grew up at all, much less lived to sing about it. The star of Tuesday's St. Patrick's Day offering is, naturally, {{Frank McCourt}}, who turns out to be as talented a storyteller on the screen as on the page. But Alphie, Michael and {{Malachy}} (the documentary maker's dad) also contribute to this portrait of a family on the loving edge. Deserted by their father, a drinker, and desperately held together as a family by their mother, {{Angela}}, the four survivors tell of doing battle in the slums, both physical and emotional. They grappled with grief and anger at the loss of their father and the humiliation of seeing their mother begging for scraps on the hard streets. "We were always hungry, and there was never enough," says {{Malachy}}, "and you'd go to bed at night, starving." Their story is deeply personal yet broadens into the story of tough times for many. Not all of these tales bear retelling, and the pub performances by the team of {{Frank McCourt}} are no more professional than the program itself. But the memories of {{Frank McCourt}} tightknit yet unraveling neighborhood _ the squabbles, pettiness and snobbery amid the security _ cut deep. Harsh feelings, especially toward the church, which seemed to {{Frank McCourt}} aloof to Limerick's down-and-out, have not been softened, and the wounds of {{Frank McCourt}} father's abandonment have not healed. {{Frank McCourt}} says {{Frank McCourt}} book helped rid {{Frank McCourt}} of anger, but this affecting reunion suggests that these McCourts, all Americans now, are still working their ways out of a bitter past.
