"To most readers today, the Bible is a confusing hodgepodge; and those who take up the daunting task of reading it from cover to cover seldom maintain their resolve beyond a book or two." So writes {{Thomas Cahill Maps}}, "The Gifts of the Jews," a sequel to the author's best-selling "How the Irish Saved Civilization" and the second book in {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} projected seven-volume "Hinges of History" series, about "the great gift-givers" who shaped Western civilization. "Though the Bible is full of literature's two great themes, love and death (as well as its exciting caricatures, sex and violence)," {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} continues, "it is also full of tedious ritual prescriptions and interminable battles. More than anything, because the Bible is the product of so many hands over so many ages, it is full of confusion for the modern reader who attempts to decode what it might be about." So he decodes it for us, the Hebrew Bible, that is, comprising Torah (or Teaching), Neviim (or Prophets) and Ketuvim (or Writings). The former director of religious publishing at Doubleday, Cahill skips over the boring parts or summarizes their implications; he skirts much scholarly controversy; he simplifies "complex questions so that the line of my argument may appear clearly;" he writes in an easy, relaxed vernacular. And he enjoys himself. He laughs at the pharaoh who asks, "Ma-zot?" ("What's this?"), "an almost comic exclamation of frustration often heard in modern Israel," when he learns that Sarah (in Genesis) is actually not {{Abraham}} sister but his wife. He delights in the accessibility of David's character: "He is the captain of the football team, the supersalesman, the engaging entertainer, the charismatic politician. We know the man." He quotes in full the beautiful King James Version of the 23rd Psalm, even though much of the English-speaking world probably knows it by heart. So the reader enjoys himself, too, happy to have gaps filled in, amused to read the author's snappy summaries of obscure occurrences, edified by his straightforward interpretations of much-debated episodes. But, as his subtitle conveys, "How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Change the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels," {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} has a much larger purpose here than simply to entertain. What he sets out to make clear is that when {{Abraham}} heard a voice telling {{Abraham}} "Go-you-forth/from your land,/from your kindred,/from your father's house,/to the land that {{Abraham}} will let you see," something new in history was happening, "a migration in the wrong direction" that "would change the face of the earth." So in his reading of the Hebrew Bible he not only traces the development of the Hebrew God from the figure who heavy-handedly called for the near-sacrifice of Isaac because "He had to jump-start this new religion, and He didn't always have the best material to work with," to what the King James calls the "still, small voice" that the Prophet Elijah heard. {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} also contrasts this development with what existed before {{Abraham}}, namely what the author describes as the static outlook of the Mesopotamian kingdom of Sumer around 2000 B.C., which conceived of time as a turning wheel without beginning or end. This section on Sumer is the most speculative in {{Thomas Cahill}}. By offering up "Gilgamesh" as an epic without much dramatic development, and by imagining an eerie Moon -cult ritual in which a priestess mounts an adolescent boy, he is more or less asking us to take his word (and that of the pre-eminent modern scholar of religion, Mircea Eliade) that the Sumerians lacked any sense of history. But the timeless atmosphere he evokes certainly contrasts vividly with the sharpness of the Hebrew imperative "lekh-lekha" ("Go forth") and the phrase "wayyelekh Avram" ("{{Abraham}} went"), which {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} calls "two of the boldest words in all of literature." And what matters, after all, are the events after {{Abraham}}. Does the thesis of "The Gifts of the Jews" stand up, persuading us that the Israelites changed history? As readers of "How the Irish Saved Civilization" will recall, {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} is fond of hyperbole. So one might take it with a grain of salt when {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} writes of the Old Testament Jews that "it may be said with some justice that theirs is the only new idea that human beings have ever had," or "We can hardly get up in the morning or cross the street without being Jewish." Then, too, {{Thomas Cahill Maps}} seems to be chiding anti-Semites, of whom he writes: "The hatred of Christians for Jews may have its ultimate source in hatred of God, a hatred that the hater must carefully keep himself from knowing about." Yet "The Gifts of the Jews" is finally persuasive as well as entertaining. "Where are the Sumerians, the Babylonians, the Assyrians today?" he asks, remarking on Jewish identity and the "unique miracle of cultural survival." "The Jews gave us the Outside and the Inside _ our outlook and our inner life," he concludes. "We dream Jewish dreams and hope Jewish hopes. Most of our best words, in fact _ new, adventure, surprise; unique, individual, person, vocation; time, history, future; freedom, progress, spirit; faith, hope, justice _ are gifts of the Jews." And so is {{Thomas Cahill}} a gift. PUBLICATION NOTES: 'THE GIFTS OF THE JEWS' How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and Feels By {{Thomas Cahill Maps}}. 291 pages. Nan A.
