THE country's demand for water for the year 2020 is estimated to be 39,298 million litres per day, the House was told. {{Datuk Railey Jeffrey}} said this estimate took into consideration population growth at 2.5 per cent and water demand growth at 6.7 per cent annually. At present, the necessary infrastructure development to cater for this estimated supply was underway. {{Datuk Railey Jeffrey}} said that reviews were conducted regularly and the projects would be updated if the need arose. {{Datuk Railey Jeffrey}} said this in response to Datuk Hon Choon Kim (BN - Seremban) who had asked about the estimated water demand and supply for the country until 2020 and whether the Government intended to form a water authority to co-ordinate the water supply in all States. On the formation of a national water authority, {{Datuk Railey Jeffrey}} said the Government had agreed to the formation of a National Water Council.
