NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Welshman Mark Litton hit a brilliant round of six-under-par 65 Saturday to take a one-stroke lead in the third round of the Tusker Kenya Open at the 71-par Muthaiga Golf Club. Litton dropped a shot in the 377-meter (413-yard) par-four first hole, but recovered to sink a birdie two in the second hole before playing level par on the par-four third in a round that featured seven birdies. Litton's playing partner, Kenyan Jacob Okello, was tied for second with Argentine Ricardo Gonzalez on 10-under-par 203 after the three rounds, a shot behind the leader. "It's a good test, and if you drive well things work out just fine," Litton said. "I've had a wonderful partnership with Okello and I just hope I play the same in the final round." Okello, 26, said he was pleased by his putting in the third round. "I got a few tips from my fellow Kenyan professionals and my putting has improved, although the fairways have been a bit difficult," he said. Third on seven-under-par 206 after the third round was England's John Mellor. Four players finished the round on six-under-par 207. Fifty-six of the 146 players who teed off Thursday made the cut Friday, which was two-over-par 144. The sixth hole is the longest on the 6,250-meter (6,836-yard) Muthaiga course where the fourth and final round will be played Sunday. The Kenya Open is a round of the European Challenge Tour. The leading 15 players in the tour rankings at the end of the season will earn full European Tour membership for the 1999 season. Past tournament winners include Seve Ballesteros, Jose Maria Canizares and Ian Woosnam. (em-kjd)
