HEERENVEEN, Netherlands (AP) {{Gunda Niemann}} smashed the 3,000-meter speedskating world record Saturday in a time of 4 minutes 5.08 seconds, shattering the old record of {{Claudia Pechstein}} which stood at 4:07.13. {{Gunda Niemann}} began {{Claudia Pechstein}} race calmly and picked up pace in the middle laps before accelerating to the new record in the closing two laps at the indoor Thialf ice stadium. Racing in the next pair, {{Claudia Pechstein}} skated 4:07.36 for second place in the race, a time that left {{Claudia Pechstein}} second to Niemann in the all-round championship with just Sunday's 5,000-meter race left. A third German, Anni Friesinger, was third in the 3,000 meters in a time of 4:11.57. "This is such a great tournament. Lots of people are skating personal bests and that motivated {{Gunda Niemann}}," {{Gunda Niemann}} said. Earlier Saturday, reigning men's world all-round champion Ids {{Ids Postma}} virtually guaranteed {{Ids Postma}} will retain {{Ids Postma}} title by narrowly beating {{Ritsma}} in a thrilling 1,500-meter race. Drawn together in the race's last pairing, {{Ids Postma}} clocked 1:48.85 to edge {{Ritsma}} time of 1:48.86 and complete a sweep of the first three of races in the four-distance all-round championship. "It was a great fight," {{Ids Postma}} said. "The (time) difference was actually nothing." {{Ritsma}} conceded that the title is now almost certainly out of {{Ritsma}} reach. With just Sunday's 10,000-meter race to go, the difference in the men's cumulative times "is enough for Ids," {{Ritsma}} said. "He will have to do something very strange and {{Ritsma}} will have to do something very strange" for {{Ids Postma}} not to win the all-round title, {{Ritsma}} added. Italian veteran Roberto Sighel was third in the 1,500 race in 1:51.19. In the day's first race, the women's 1,500 meters, defending all-round champion {{Gunda Niemann}} also pushed {{Claudia Pechstein}} into second, powering to victory in 1:58.69 seconds. U.S. skater Chris Witty also ducked under the two-minute mark to land third place in 1:59.46. (mc)
