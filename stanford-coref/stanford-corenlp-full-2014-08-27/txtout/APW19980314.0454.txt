DUNBLANE, Scotland (AP) _ Townspeople dedicated a garden Saturday in memory of 16 children and a teacher killed by a suicidal gunman two years ago. "This garden is a beautiful place in which we can all remember the loved ones we lost," said {{Mick North}}. "The cheerfulness and brightness of a Primary One classroom is evoked by each one of the pebbles in the pools, {{Mick North}} can almost hear the chatter of children in the sound of the fountain," {{Mick North}} said at the dedication ceremony. A local man, 43-year -old Thomas Hamilton, barged into the primary school on March 13, 1996 and opened fire on a class in the gym. In addition to those killed, he injured 12 other children and two teachers before killing himself. Britain has since banned handgun ownership. The memorial garden, designed by the victims' families, features a bronze plaque with the names of the dead, a cherry tree and a variety of flowers. Another memorial to the Dunblane victims, a sculpture of stone and wood, is to be unveiled April 5 in the National Forest in northern England. (rb)
