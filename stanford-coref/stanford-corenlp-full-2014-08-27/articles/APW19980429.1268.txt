BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Police said Wednesday that a 19-year -old man had confessed to killing an 11-year -old girl, whose brutal stabbing at her home earlier this month caught nationwide attention. The state news agency MTI reported the arrest of a man other media identified as Gabor Tanczos, who reportedly followed the girl home April 3. She did not close the door properly, as she was about to leave for a music class, when her killer walked in, hit her and then stabbed her to death, according to media accounts. Her mother and brother were abroad and her father, who was to pick her up at school, was delayed when his car broke down. The murder shocked the small town of Koermend, 200 kilometers (125 miles) southwest of Budapest, and the nation. Extra police were sent to the town to patrol. Tanczos was questioned by police. Contradictions in his account led investigators to take a closer look, when they found his fingerprints in the girl's home, MTI said. The young man then confessed, it reported, adding that police still do not know the motive. The girl, who has not been identified in media reports, was not molested sexually and nothing was removed from the premises. (ab/as)
